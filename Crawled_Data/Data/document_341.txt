The housemates are continuously monitored during their stay in the house by live television cameras as well as personal audio microphones. Throughout the course of the competition, housemates are evicted from the house - voted-out of the competition. The last remaining housemate wins the competition and is awarded a cash prize. The series takes its name from the character in George Orwell's 1949 novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. The series premiered on 18 July 2000 on Channel 4, and immediately became a ratings hit.[2] It featured a 24-hour live feed, in which fans could view inside the house at any time. Big Brother aired for eleven series on Channel 4, followed by one final special edition, Ultimate Big Brother, which ended on 10 September 2010.[3][4] Following this, Channel 5 acquired the rights to the series, and it was officially relaunched on 18 August 2011.[5] It was announced on 19 March 2015 that the show would remain on air until at least 2018.[6] The programme was initially presented by Davina McCall from its inception to its cancellation by Channel 4. Despite being offered the position of presenter following the programme's move to Channel 5, McCall chose not to return. Former winner Brian Dowling became the presenter, a position he held throughout the twelfth and thirteenth series.[7] Emma Willis later replaced Dowling as the presenter of the series from the fourteenth series onwards.[8] Marcus Bentley has been the narrator of the series since it premiered in 2000. Big Brother has had numerous spin-off series occur since its premiere, most notably Celebrity Big Brother, which is a shorter version of the main series wherein the cast is composed solely of celebrities. Numerous other spin-off series that are not competition based have aired, with Dermot O'Leary,[9] Russell Brand,[10] George Lamb,[11] Emma Willis and Rylan Clark-Neal all presenting spin-offs. Over the course of its run, there were a total of 45 series of Big Brother in the UK: nineteen regular series, twenty-two celebrity series and four other series. On 14 September 2018 (the day of the nineteenth and final series launch), Channel 5 announced that Big Brother and Celebrity Big Brother would not be returning to the channel after the end of the series. The final series of Big Brother was won by Cameron Cole on 5 November 2018.[12] In 2020, Channel 4 announced that previous episodes of Big Brother would be shown on E4 in a series titled Big Brother: Best Shows Ever to mark the 20th anniversary of the programme.[13] Contents 1 History 1.1 Main series 1.1.1 Channel 4 (2000–2010) 1.1.2 Channel 5 (2011–2018) 1.1.3 Cancellation 1.2 Spin-offs 2 Format 3 House 4 Broadcast 5 Legacy 6 Series details and viewership 7 Sponsorships 7.1 Channel 4 (2000–2010) 7.2 Channel 5 (2011–2018) 8 Controversies and criticism 9 Awards and nominations 10 See also 11 Footnotes 12 External links History[edit] Main series[edit] Channel 4 (2000–2010)[edit] The Big Brother reality series was created by John de Mol and premiered in the Netherlands.[14][15] Following the success of the initial series, it was confirmed that editions for both the United Kingdom and the United States were in the works.[16] In March 2000, it was revealed that the series would be broadcast by Channel 4 and E4;[17] casting began shortly afterward,[18] and Davina McCall was later revealed to be the presenter.[19] The first series premiered on 18 July 2000, and ended when housemate Craig Phillips was crowned the winner after 64 days in the House.[19][20] The series proved to be a hit early in its run, leading to a second series.[21] Big Brother 2 premiered on 25 May 2001, and continued the success of the previous series.[22] The series concluded on 27 July 2001, when Brian Dowling was crowned the winner.[23] The third series premiered on 24 May 2002, and was the first series to feature a live premiere.[citation needed] Much like the previous series', the show lasted for 64 days, and saw Kate Lawler win the prize.[24] With the third series finding even more success than its predecessors, a fourth series began on 23 May 2003.[25][26] The series was one of the first to feature numerous twists throughout the series, including nominations on the first night and swapping a housemate with a housemate from the African edition of the series.[27] The series concluded after 64 days, with Cameron Stout being crowned the winner.[28] Despite the fourth series seeing a decrease in viewership and voting numbers, a fifth series began on 28 May 2004.[29] The series became one of the most controversial series at the time, mainly due to events such as "Fight Night" and the expulsion of two housemates.[30][31] The series lasted for 71 days, with Nadia Almada becoming the first transgender housemate to win the series.[32][33] Following the success of the fifth series, the sixth series began on 27 May 2005, and lasted for a total of 78 days.[34] The series was met with much controversy surrounding housemates Anthony Hutton and Makosi Musambasi, the former of which went on to win the series.[35][citation needed] The seventh series premiered on 18 May 2006, and became the first series to feature over twenty housemates.[36] It became the first series to last longer than 90 days, and was met with much controversy after allowing previously evicted housemate Nikki Grahame to return to the game with the chance of winning.[37][38] Pete Bennett was ultimately crowned the winner of the series.[39] The following series premiered on 30 May 2007, and became the longest series to date at 94 days.[citation needed] The series featured a set of twins in the house, who competed initially as individuals but later became one housemate.[40] Brian Belo was crowned the winner of the series.

Spin-offs[edit] Main article: List of Big Brother (UK) shows Since its inception, Big Brother has seen numerous spin-offs and tie-in series' launch on both Channel 4 and Channel 5. The most notable spin-off, Celebrity Big Brother, began initially as a one-time series and involved six celebrities staying in the house for eight days.[62][63] Following the success of the series, Celebrity Big Brother went on to become an annual production, much like the main series.[64][65] Following widespread media attention involving racism during the fifth series, the show was not broadcast the following year.[66][67][68] The show returned in 2009, and the final series to air on Channel 4 aired in 2010.[citation needed] Following the show's move to Channel 5, Celebrity Big Brother began airing two series per year.[69] The show has also had various other spin-off series occur since its premiere. The first spin-off, Teen Big Brother: The Experiment, premiered on 13 October 2003 and lasted for a total of ten days.[citation needed] The series was met with much controversy, which was later heightened when two of the cast members had sex in the house.[70] Big Brother Panto, which aired in 2004, saw the return of ten former housemates who re-enacted their rendition of Cinderella.[71] Ultimate Big Brother was the final series to air on Channel 4, and featured fourteen of the most memorable housemates from both the main series and Celebrity Big Brother competing in the series.[72][73] Brian Dowling became the only housemate to win a series twice after winning Ultimate Big Brother.[citation needed] Numerous other spin-offs have occurred throughout the series such as Big Brother's Big Mouth, presented by Russell Brand, and Big Brother's Little Brother presented by Dermot O'Leary.[74][75][76] Following the show's move to Channel 5, Big Brother's Bit on the Side and Celebrity Big Brother are the only spin-off series now airing.[77] Format[edit] "Big Brother house, this is Davina. You are live on Channel 4; please do not swear. (nominated housemates' names), the lines are closed; the votes have been counted and verified, and I can now reveal that the nth person to be evicted from the Big Brother House is...(evicted housemate's name). (Evicted housemate's name), you have 30 seconds to say your goodbyes; I'm coming to get you!" — McCall's speech when announcing the evicted housemate. This was altered by future presenters. Big Brother is a game show in which a group of contestants, referred to as housemates, live in isolation from the outside world in a custom built "house", constantly under video surveillance.[78] During their time in the house, the housemates are required to nominate two of their fellow contestants for potential eviction, and the two or more with the most votes would be nominated.[79] This process is mandatory for all housemates, and failure to comply could result in expulsion from the house.[80] During the show's broadcast on Channel 4, the viewers would vote to evict one of the nominated housemates, and the housemate with the most votes would be removed from the house.[81] The twelfth and thirteenth series, the first two to air under Channel 5, saw the public voting to save a housemate, and the housemate with the fewest votes would be evicted.[82] Beginning with the fourteenth series, the vote to evict format returned to the series.[83] During the eighteenth series, both vote to save and vote to evict were used. The voting process can be done via telephone or online.[84] When the final week arrives, the viewers vote for which of the remaining housemates should win the series, and the housemate with the most votes becomes the winner.[85] The prize fund has varied throughout the series, ranging from £50,000 to £150,000.[citation needed] During their time in the house, housemates are given weekly tasks to perform.[16] The housemates wager a portion of their weekly shopping budget on the task, and either win double their wagered fund or lose the wagered fund depending on their performance in the task.[86] The housemates are required to work as a group to complete their tasks, with the format of the tasks varying based on the number of remaining housemates. Throughout the series, some housemates have been given secret tasks that must either be completed individually or with a small group; failure to do so can result in the housemate being nominated or punished in the house.[87] Should the housemates run out of the food provided for them, an emergency ration is available to them. The housemates are forbidden from discussing nominations, and doing so could result in punishment.[88][89] The format of the series is mainly seen as a social experiment, and requires housemates to interact with others who may have differing ideals, beliefs, and prejudices.[90][91] Housemates are also required to make visits to the diary room during their stay in the house, where they are able to share their thoughts and feelings on their fellow housemates and the game.[92] House[edit] For the first two series, the house was located in Bow, London, near the 3 Mills Studios.[93] After planning permission expired in 2002, Newham London Borough Council ordered the complex to be returned to a natural habitat.[94] The house has been located at Elstree Studios, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire since Big Brother 3 in 2002.[94] Following a break in during the second series, it was reported that security had increased to the point that the house was more secure than Buckingham Palace.[95][96][97] The interior of the house has changed each year, reflecting a certain theme or twist in the game. The fifth series, which featured stricter rules and consequences, featured a harsh colour scheme and a claustrophobic setting.[98][99] The third series featured a "Rich and Poor" twist, thus a row of bars was placed in the centre of the house to divide the housemates.[100][101] The diary room features a different design each year, and is frequently the last room of the house to be revealed to the public.[102] Each series has featured a garden in the house, which has included outdoor furniture, a Jacuzzi, and on some occasions other luxuries.[103][104] The eighth series featured an "inside out" theme for the house, thus items such as the refrigerator were located in the garden.[105][106] On 2 February 2016, a planning application to Hertsmere Borough Council first revealed that Endemol had applied to build a new extension to the house, which would be its biggest renovation to the house since it was built in 2002. The documents teased a second house with another garden, as well as a new exterior set and interview studio.[107] The old eviction set and eye studio were both demolished following the conclusion of Celebrity Big Brother 17.[108] It was later announced on 18 March 2016 that permission had been granted with no objections. Despite the overall extension, the new outdoor set was smaller than before, holding a capacity of just 400 compared to 470 beforehand.[109] From Celebrity Big Brother 19, the other house was referred to as The Task Building making it the house's third task room along with the small and large task room. In January 2019 (two months after the conclusion of the nineteenth and final series), work began to demolish the house at Elstree Studios. On 17 February 2019, former presenter Emma Willis posted a picture to her Instagram showing that demolition work on the house was complete. Broadcast[edit] Russell Brand (above) presented the spin-off series Big Brother's Big Mouth. During the premiere series, the show aired six nights a week, being every night excluding Saturday.[110] The eviction episodes and final aired on Fridays;[20] after series presenter McCall announced the evictee, they had two hours to pack their belongings and exit the house during a second episode airing that night.[111] The remaining five weekly shows were highlight episodes, which lasted an hour in length; the Sunday episode featured a group of psychologists discussing the events of the house.[90][112] The second series aired six nights a week during the premiere week, though was reduced to only five days afterward, not airing on Saturday or Sunday.[22] This series featured two eviction episodes as well, though only featured a ninety-minute gap between the two.[113] Big Brother 3 was the first series to air every night each week, and every series thereafter featured only thirty minutes between eviction episodes.[22] The third series was the first in the main series to feature a live launch, with all subsequent series featuring a live launch.[114] The series continued to air for seven nights a week until Big Brother 8, which aired every night excluding Saturday.[22] The ninth series re-introduced the seven episodes per week format, which has been continued throughout all future series'.[115][116] When the series premiered, it was aired in a 4:3 aspect ratio instead of the more common 16:9 widescreen format seen by other series at the time.[117] Beginning in 2006 with the seventh series, the show was broadcast in the 16:9 format.[118] Following the show's move to Channel 5, it was broadcast in HD.[119][120] The series can be viewed on Demand 5, a branch of Channel 5, after it airs.[121] Aside from the main series, the show featured a live feed into the house where viewers could watch the housemates at any time.[122] With the series debut in 2000, the twenty-four-hour live feed was introduced which was available at any time to viewers for free.[123] The live feed featured an estimated ten-minute delay to comply with broadcasting standards.[124] Beginning with the second series, the live feed became available on E4 as well.[125] In 2009, it was confirmed that the live feeds would not return for the tenth series due to a "small uptake" of subscriptions in the previous year. The feeds did return the following year, though required viewers to pay a fee, for what was at the time slated to be the show's final series.[126] Following the show's move to Channel 5, the live feeds have not been featured for any subsequent series.[127] In 2013, it was announced that the live feed would return in the form of a two-hour nightly show that featured a live look into the House;[128][129] the show was cancelled in June of that year, reportedly due to low ratings.[130][131][132][133] Despite this, the feed was re-instated onto the official Channel 5 website for the remainder of the fourteenth series.[134] Numerous spin-off series have aired either immediately after or shortly following both the highlight episodes and the live episodes. Big Brother's Big Mouth, aired following the highlight shows. The show was initially presented by Russell Brand from 2004 to 2007,[135] but he did not return for subsequent series which featured a different presenter weekly.[136] Big Brother's Big Mouth did not return following the show's move to Channel 5.[137] Throughout the third, fourth, and fifth series' there were no weekly tasks, and the housemates instead participated in tasks during the Saturday Night Live weekly show.[138][139] Big Brother's Big Brain also aired once per week, and featured a more psychological analysis of the series;[140] it aired for two series, being renamed Big Brother: On the Couch for its second and final series.[141] Big Brother's Bit on the Side is aired seven nights a week on Channel 5 and 5*, either immediately following or an hour after the nightly episode.[142][143] Live from the House, which features a live feed into the house, airs immediately following the live eviction episode.[144][145] Big Brother theme song.

The opening theme for the series was both written and produced by Elementfour, which is a collaboration between Paul Oakenfold and Andy Gray.[146] Following the success of the first series, the theme was released as a single on 28 August 2000.[147] The single proved to be successful, reaching number 4 on the UK Singles Chart.[148][149] The theme was also featured on the soundtrack for the first series, which was released that same year.[150] Since the series premiered, there have been numerous remixes and changes made to the song. The original theme by Oakenfeld and Gray was used through the first five series, however was later replaced by a revamped version from the sixth series onward.[151] The song was remixed with a Christmas theme to promote Big Brother Panto in 2004, while a carnival themed edition was made to promote the final series to air on Channel 4.[152] The intro to each series, which featured the theme song, was often based on the twist or theme of the house for the year.[153] Each series is promoted with a different eye logo,[154] with the logo also representing the theme of the house.[155][156] The eye logo is meant to symbolize the phrase "Big Brother is watching" taken from the Orwell novel.[citation needed] The logo for the first series was a close-up of housemate Melanie Hill's eye, while the logos for the second through eleventh series' were created by Daniel Eatock.[157] Design team Hello Charlie, who had previously created the series intros, created the eye logo for the twelfth and thirteenth series following the show's move to Channel 5.[158][159][160] The fourteenth to eighteenth series logos were created by the design studio Shop.
