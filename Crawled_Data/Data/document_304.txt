It is situated near the Delhi–Haryana border, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) southwest of the national capital New Delhi and 268 km (167 mi) south of Chandigarh, the state capital.[5] It is one of the major satellite cities of Delhi and is part of the National Capital Region of India.[6] As of 2011[update], Gurgaon had a population of 1,153,000.[1][3] Gurgaon is India's second largest information technology hub and third largest financial and banking hub.[7][8] Gurgaon is also home to India's largest medical tourism industry.[9] Despite being India's 56th largest city in terms of population, Gurgaon is the 8th largest city in the country in terms of total wealth.[10] Gurgaon serves as the headquarters of many of India's largest companies, is home to thousands of startup companies and has local offices for more than 250 Fortune 500 companies.[11] It accounts for almost 70% of the total annual economic investments in Haryana state, which has helped it become a leading hub for high-tech industry in northern India.[12] Gurgaon is categorised as very high on the Human Development Index, with an HDI of 0.889 (2017).[13] Most infrastructure in the city is made by private corporations.[citation needed] Gurgaon's economic growth started in the 1970s when Maruti Suzuki India Limited established a manufacturing plant and gathered pace after General Electric established its business outsourcing operations in the city in collaboration with real-estate firm DLF.[14][15] New Gurgaon, Manesar and Sohna serve as adjoining manufacturing and upcoming real estate hubs for Gurgaon. Despite rapid economic and population growth, Gurgaon continues to battle socio-economic issues, such as high-income inequality and high air pollution.[16][17] It also has a flood problem due to the limited drainage capacity.[18] Contents 1 History 2 Geography 2.1 Topography 2.2 Ecology 2.3 Climate 3 Demographics 3.1 Religion 4 Cityscape 4.1 Architecture 4.2 Neighbourhoods 4.3 Parks 5 Culture 5.1 Entertainment and performing arts 5.2 Languages and dialect 5.3 Religion 5.4 Sports 6 Economy 7 Law and government 8 Crime 9 Education 10 Transport 10.1 Roadways 10.2 Railways 10.2.1 Intercity rail 10.2.2 Delhi Metro 10.2.3 Rapid Metro 10.3 Airways 10.3.1 Airport 10.4 Transit systems 10.4.1 Public transit 11 Utilities 12 Issues 12.1 Flooding 13 See also 14 References 15 Further reading 16 External links History See also: History of Haryana, Badshahpur, and Jharsa The region of Gurgaon originally fell under the Kuru Kingdom.[19] Early people to inhabit the region were Hindus ruled over by the Ahir clan.[20] Yadu tribes were a part of this clan and today their descendants commonly hold the last name Yadav. In late 4th century BCE, the city was absorbed by the Maurya Empire as part of Chandragupta Maurya's earliest expansions of his kingdom.[21] Gurgaon may be same as the Gudapura town mentioned in the 12th century text Prithviraja Vijaya. According to the text, Nagarjuna, a cousin of the Chahamana king Prithviraj Chauhan, rebelled against the king and captured the town. Prithviraj crushed the rebellion and recaptured the town.[22][23] During the Mughal and initially during the British colonial era, Gurgaon was just a small village in Jharsa paragana of Delhi subah. Report of a Tour in Eastern Rajputana in 1882–83 (published in 1885) by Alexander Cunningham, the then Director-General of Archaeological Survey of India, he mentions a stone pillar at Gurgaon of a local feudal lord "Durgga Naga" with a 3-line inscription "Samvat 729 or 928, Vaisakh badi 4, Durgga Naga lokatari bhuta" dating back to 672 AD or 871 AD. Jharsa paragana passed to Begum Samru in 1776–77 and came under direct British rule in 1836 after her death when her territory was taken over by the British who established a civil lines at Jharsa and a cavalry cantonment at nearby Hiyadatpur. A 1882 land revenue settlement report records that the idol of Sitla Mata was brought to Gurgaon 400 years earlier (15th century). Begum Samru claimed the offering to Sitla Mata temple during the Chaitra month and the revenue from the offerings given to the deity for rest of the month was distributed among the prominent Jat zamindars of the area.[24] In 1818, Bharawas district was disbanded and Gurgaon was made a new district. In 1821, the Bharaswas cantonment was also moved to Hidayatpur in Gurgaon.[25] "Aliwardi mosque" in Gurgaon, "Badshahpur baoli" (1905).[26][27] and "Bhondsi" (16th to 17th century) were built during mughal and British era.[28] The "Church of the Epiphany" and "Kaman Serai" (Corrupted form of the "Command Serai" or Officer's Mess") was built by the Britishers in 1925 inside the civil lines.[28] Other British colonial era historic buildings The Gurgaon Club, a 3-room building surrounded by the lawn and currently run by the Zila Parishad, the erstwhile Coronation School—now renamed to the Government Boys’ Senior Secondary School, one of the 13 school established in India in 1911 to commemorate the coronation of King George V.[29] During 1980s, the airstrip and hangar, air conditioned yoga ashram and TV studio were built on outskirts of the city by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's yoga mentor Dhirendra Brahmachari.[30] The former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar established his own ashram near this airstrip in 1983 on 600 acre of panchayat land, where another godman Chandraswami and notorious Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi used to visit him.[31][32] On 12 April 2016, Chief Minister of Haryana Manohar Lal Khattar announced a proposal to officially rename the city Gurugram (Sanskrit: गुरुग्राम, lit. village of the Guru), subject to the approval of the Haryana cabinet and the Union Government. He argued that the new name would help to preserve the "rich heritage" of the city by emphasising its history and mythological association with Drona.[33][34][35] On 27 September 2016, he officially announced that the Union Government had approved the name change, and thus the city and district would henceforth be known as Gurugram,[36] though the old name "Gurgaon" still lingers in the colloquial usage.[37] Geography Gurgaon is located in Gurgaon district in the Indian state of Haryana and is situated in the southeastern part of the state, and northern part of the country.

GE's setup in Gurgaon prompted other companies, both international as well as domestic, to follow suit[54] providing outsourcing solutions in software, IT, service and sales through delivery facilities and call centres. However, due to the lack of proper public transport and the inability of most of the employees to afford a personal vehicle, most of the call centres provide pooled-in cars to and from their offices.[54] Apart from Business process outsourcing and IT sectors, the city is home to several other companies that specialise in domain expertise. Siemens Industry Software, in Gurgaon Business Park, made a portfolio of design software that was used by NASA to digitally design, simulate and assemble the vehicle before any physical prototypes were built.[54] Various international companies, including Coca-Cola, Pepsi, BMW, Agilent Technologies, Hyundai have chosen Gurgaon to be their Indian corporate headquarters.[54] All the major companies in the city depend on their own backup, given the fact that Gurgaon does not have reliable power and water supply, public transport and utilities.

A recent research report puts the blame on the broken natural water body linkage and obstructions in the flow in the city due to frantic construction during the last decades.[41]The HUDA master drainage lines get choked or burst at the seams. Disruptions in the hydrological flow of natural drains and limited drainage capacity are all primary reasons for the floods.[74] Gurgaon's Ghata Jheel, Badshahpur Jheel, Khandsa Talab were linked to Najafgarh drain which links to Yamuna river, via natural water channels and drains.[41] As per the ground reports and research, the three natural water bodies are struggling for their existence with encroachments on their lands and natural channels. Agencies responsible have tried to create artificial water bodies to compensate, but the efforts fail due to unpredictable rain and water flow patterns leading to deployment of water pumps to fight the situation.[75] In 2012 Punjab & Haryana High court banned ground water usage for construction activity,[76] and NGT has recently reprimanded authorities for drain concretization.[77] See also Bahadurgarh Faridabad Dharuhera Rohtak Delhi NCR New Gurgaon References ^ a b c d "Demography Gurgaon". ^ "Gurgaon City". ^ a b "Cities having population 1 lakh and above, Census 2011" (PDF). censusindia.gov.in.
