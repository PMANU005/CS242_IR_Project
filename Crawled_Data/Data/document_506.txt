Author: ROGER CATLIN; Courant TV Critic Date: May 7, 2004 Start Page: A.1 Section: MAIN (A) Text Word Count: 688 Abstract (Document Summary) "Friends" ended as it began in 1994, with sex jokes and a strong flirtation between the [Ross] character, played by David Schwimmer, and Jennifer Aniston's [Rachel]. The episode titled "The Last One" began in the apres-sex afterglow between the two on the eve of her leaving for a job in Paris. Their relationship had been consummated before on the series, including once for a baby -- now supposedly age 1 -- who remained unseen throughout the episode. This time had more meaning for Ross, who wanted to get back together, than it initially had for Rachel, who thought it was a good way to say goodbye. Aside from an ad that heralded his upcoming fall spin-off comedy "Joey," there was nothing in the finale to set up Matt LeBlanc's new show, in which his character moves to L.A. But he turned serious before disassembling the foosball table he and [Chandler] had so often used (so he could rescue a baby chick and duckling inside).
