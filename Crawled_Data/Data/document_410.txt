The 1990s show starring comedian Jerry Seinfeld as a New York comedian hanging out with three of his pals -- Elaine, George and Kramer -- topped TV Guide's list of the 50 most entertaining or influential television series in American pop culture. The list, appearing in next week's issue, will get the countdown treatment in an ABC special on May 13, "TV Guide's 50 Best Shows of All Time," part of the magazine's celebration of its golden anniversary. The 50 entries, chosen and ranked by TV Guide editors, consist of regularly scheduled series spanning more than a half century of television, going as far back as NBC's pioneering live comedy/variety program, "Your Show of Shows." That show, which debuted in 1950 starring Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca, was ranked No. 30. TV movies, miniseries and specials were not eligible. Prime time accounts for most of the shows, though a few daytime programs made the list -- NBC's "Today" (No. 17) and the syndicated talk shows "Donahue" (No. 29) and "The Oprah Winfrey Show" (No. 49). On the late-night front, the CBS "Late Show with David Letterman" got the highest ranking, at No. 7, beating out even NBC's "The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson" (No. 12). Letterman's arch rival -- and Carson's successor -- Jay Leno, failed to make the cut. ABC's "Nightline" ranked 23rd. NBC dominated the list with 17 shows, which, besides "Seinfeld," ranged from "Saturday Night Live" at No. 10 to the Judd Hirsch sitcom "Taxi," which also aired on ABC, at No. 48. CBS made the list with 16 shows, led by "I Love Lucy" at No. 2, and boasted five other programs in the top 10, including "The Honeymooners" (No. 3), "All in the Family" (No. 4), "60 Minutes" (No. 6) and "The Andy Griffith Show" (No. 9). A total of eight ABC shows made the list, led by the late-1980s, early '90s drama "thirtysomething," while Fox had two entries -- animated sitcom satire "The Simpsons" at No. 8 and sci-fi thriller "The X-Files" at No. 37. The only other cartoon series to make the list was ABC's "Rocky and His Friends" at No. 47. Cable television was represented by just two shows -- mob drama "The Sopranos" at No. 5 and Garry Shandling's "The Larry Sanders Show" at No. 38, both on HBO. Public TV also had two series on the list -- the landmark children's program "Sesame Street" (No. 27) and the pioneering 1973 "reality" series "An American Family" (No. 32). But modern-day reality hit "Survivor" was snubbed, as were all game shows. Not even "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" made the list. The fledgling networks the WB and UPN had to settle for one shared entry, "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," which has aired on both outlets. The following is the complete list: 1. Seinfeld (NBC) 2. I Love Lucy (CBS) 3. The Honeymooners (CBS) 4. All in the Family (CBS) 5. The Sopranos (HBO) 6. 60 Minutes (CBS) 7. Late Show with David Letterman (CBS) 8. The Simpsons (Fox) 9.

That says all you need to know aot this worthless list. Laughable Reply to this comment by spencerpahrmd July 21, 2012 6:29 PM EDT i'm shocked and appalled that some of these shows are placed above mash- about 24 of them really, but friends and thritysomething in particular are just plain insulting. Reply to this comment by Davedlb12 July 15, 2012 11:40 PM EDT Clearly "The Wire" is the best show of all time this list is not correct Reply to this comment by razenDan May 29, 2012 4:59 AM EDT I find it just amazing that the original Star Trek is missing completely while Star Trek: The Next Generation IS on the list! It would have made more sense to have the top 10 news shows, top 10 comedy shows, top 10 sci-fi shows, top 10 drama shows, etc. Reply to this comment by Shahzoorsafdar April 18, 2012 9:02 AM EDT I can't believe two and a half men didn't make he list.. The show is absolutely hilarious. Reply to this comment by mjsmith74 April 13, 2012 7:19 PM EDT How in the heck is the original Hawaii Five-O not on this "list"? Half these shows I wouldn't even want to watch, I disliked them so. This oversight is another reason why I don't subscribe to this dirtrag. Reply to this comment by Katnapper66 March 29, 2012 7:45 PM EDT Where is Little House on the Prarie??? It's a shame this show isn't here. Reply to this comment by ricksmiff January 11, 2012 8:01 AM EST What about "my so called life"that gone too soon series which has got to be one of the greatest shows ever Reply to this comment by watkinsjr2000 January 3, 2012 2:19 PM EST Who in their right mind could actually believe that "Twin Peaks"(#45) was a better TV show than either "LA Law" or "NYPD Blue"(neither even MADE the top 50)??? And, what kind of a nitwit consider "Thirtysomething"(#19) a better TV show than the timeless classic "MASH" (#25)?? Reply to this comment by mlc2005 December 22, 2011 9:42 PM EST This has to be the worst "best of" list I have ever seen. TV Guide, a magazine devoted to television, should have done a MUCH better job than this. "Friends" ranks higher than "Roseanne"????? No "West Wing" is absurd, considering it's a masterpiece that won more Emmys than any TV show in history. I mean, come on people. "Donahue" ranks above "Oprah?" Where are "Golden Girls," "Sex and the City," "Six Feet Under?" This list does appear bogus to me.
