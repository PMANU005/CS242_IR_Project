(Atlantis Communications), was granted a television broadcasting licence by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for a channel called YOU: Your Channel, described at the time as broadcasting "programming consisting of documentaries and information programming." The channel was grouped into five themes, "Habitat" stressing programming for the home and environment; "Bodyworks" covering fitness, health and nutrition; "Food Plus" including programs related to cooking and food; "Explorations" dealing with travel, adventure and nature; and "Relationships" focusing on parenting, child care, careers and personal relationships."[1] The channel was launched on January 1, 1995, as Life Network.[2] The channel broadcast programs in themes focusing on such areas as food, gardening, and home design. In June 1998, Atlantis Communications announced that it planned to merge with Alliance Communications,[3] another fellow television and film producer and broadcaster, owners of History Television and Showcase at the time,[4] to form a new company called Alliance Atlantis Communications. The CRTC approved the merger in May 1999.[4] As Slice[edit] Plans to relaunch the channel as Slice were announced in November 2, 2006 by Alliance Atlantis Communications.[5] The new name and programming reflects Life's shift towards a more entertainment based schedule with what Alliance Atlantis called "addictive" programming. The name was revealed in a 2006 Life Network online survey on future programming strategies. The channel was relaunched on March 5, 2007, although the on-air branding appeared intermittently during a "sneak preview" on March 3 and 4. On January 18, 2008,[6] a joint venture between Canwest and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners known as CW Media,[7] acquired control of Slice through its purchase of Alliance Atlantis' broadcasting assets, which were placed in a trust in August 2007.[8] On October 27, 2010, ownership changed again as Shaw Communications gained control of Slice as a result of its acquisition of Canwest and Goldman Sachs' interest in CW Media.[9][10] On May 29, 2013, a high definition simulcast of Slice was launched. It is available through all major TV providers. On April 1, 2016, Shaw Media was sold to Corus Entertainment.
