NIELSEN RATINGS FOR 1999-2000 - SFGate56 captures 03 Feb 2014 - 30 Jan 2022 Jan FEB Jan 03 2013 2014 2015 success fail About this capture COLLECTED BY Organization: Internet Archive These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to. That way, as the pages that are referenced are changed or taken from the web, a link to the version that was live when the page was written will be preserved. Then the Internet Archive hopes that references to these archived pages will be put in place of a link that would be otherwise be broken, or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page's authors. The goal is to fix all broken links on the web. Crawls of supported "No More 404" sites. Collection: Wikipedia Near Real Time (from IRC) This is a collection of web page captures from links added to, or changed on, Wikipedia pages. The idea is to bring a reliability to Wikipedia outlinks so that if the pages referenced by Wikipedia articles are changed, or go away, a reader can permanently find what was originally referred to. This is part of the Internet Archive's attempt to rid the web of broken links.

The first number is the show's average rating, the second is its average percentage share of the viewing audience. Each ratings point represents about 1 million households in the United States. For unexplained reasons, a few series that aired during the season are missing from the final Nielsen list. They include "Wonderland," "The Mike O'Malley Show," "Ryan Caulfield: Year One" and "Mission Hill." Nielsen Media Research couldn't be reached late yesterday.
