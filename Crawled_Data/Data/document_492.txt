That way, as the pages that are referenced are changed or taken from the web, a link to the version that was live when the page was written will be preserved. Then the Internet Archive hopes that references to these archived pages will be put in place of a link that would be otherwise be broken, or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page's authors. The goal is to fix all broken links on the web. Crawls of supported "No More 404" sites. Collection: Wikipedia Near Real Time (from IRC) This is a collection of web page captures from links added to, or changed on, Wikipedia pages. The idea is to bring a reliability to Wikipedia outlinks so that if the pages referenced by Wikipedia articles are changed, or go away, a reader can permanently find what was originally referred to. This is part of the Internet Archive's attempt to rid the web of broken links.

I didn't like this show nearly as much after watching tonight's pilot as I did after taking in the second and third episodes, offering added proof that some shows - particularly comedies - need a little bit of time to find their legs, to walk after they crawl. "Friends" doesn't start walking Complete Article, 758 words ( ) All content copyrighted and may not be republished without permission.
