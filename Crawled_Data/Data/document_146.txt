Contents 1 Early life 2 Career 3 Personal life 4 Filmography 5 References 6 External links Early life[edit] Wheeler was born Margaret Emily Jakobson in New York City, the daughter of Barbara, a writer, and John Jakobson, who began his career on Wall Street as one of the youngest members of the New York Stock Exchange.[1] She was raised in a secular Jewish household and graduated from The Calhoun School in New York City.[2] Career[edit] In the 1980s, Wheeler (under her maiden name of Jakobson) briefly dabbled in voice acting on the animated series SilverHawks, where she provided all the female voices, specifically the villainess Melodia and the heroine Steelheart/Emily Hart, and on the Karate Kat and Mini-Monsters segments of The Comic Strip. She also starred in the 1989 film, New Year's Day, alongside David Duchovny. After she became Maggie Wheeler, there has been a rumor that she auditioned for the role of Monica Geller in the series Friends. However, she denied this in an interview, stating that she only auditioned for the role of Janice Goralnik, which she was invited to play.[3] Janice was a recurring character of the series and particularly known as a frequent love interest of main character Chandler Bing. She appeared at least once in each season; her 19 episodes tie her with Christina Pickles for Friends’ third most frequent guest actor, behind only Elliott Gould's 20 episodes, and James Michael Tyler's 150 episodes. She also auditioned for the role of Debra Barone, on the American sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond. Although she was the producers' choice, CBS ended up selecting Patricia Heaton. Instead, Wheeler played the recurring role of Debra's friend, Linda. According to Kathy Griffin's autobiography, Official Book Club Selection, Wheeler was cast in the role of Vicki for the pilot episode of Suddenly Susan and was eventually replaced by Griffin.[4] She had a star billing in the first season of Ellen. She appeared on the hit comedy Seinfeld in the episode "The Fix-Up", as one of Elaine's friends who is set up with George. She has appeared in many other television programs, including Drake & Josh, ER, The X-Files, The War at Home, Will & Grace, Jack and Jill, How I Met Your Mother and Curb Your Enthusiasm. In 1997, Wheeler voiced Harley Quinn's replacement in the Batman: The Animated Series episode "Joker's Millions". In 1998, she appeared in the remake of Disney's The Parent Trap, playing the younger of a mother-daughter pair of camp counselors. Wheeler provided the voice of Odile in Barbie of Swan Lake, and in 2010 she voiced Trinette in four episodes of Archer on FX. In 2011, she guest-starred in the Disney Channel series Shake It Up as Dina's mother. Personal life[edit] She has been married to sculptor Daniel Borden Wheeler since 1990.[5][6] Filmography[edit] Film roles Year Title Role Notes 1982 Soup for One Nurse 1983 Portfolio Assistant Choreographer 1987 Someone to Love Attendee 1989 Mortal Sins Marie New Year's Day Lucy 1993 Sexual Healing Suzanne Short film 1998 The Parent Trap Marva Kulp, Jr 2003 Barbie of Swan Lake Odile Voice role; direct-to-video film 2006 Dr. Dolittle 3 Brown Hen / Fluffy Hen 2007 Waking Dreams Jenny 2015 The 3 Tails: A Mermaid Adventure Maria 2019 The Addams Family Trudy Pickering Voice role 2021 Mark, Mary & Some Other People Lisa Television roles Year Title Role Notes 1984 The New Show Various 8 episodes 1985 The Paper Chase N/A Episode: "The Day Kingsfield Missed Class" 1986 SilverHawks Melodia / Steelheart Voice role; main role 1990 L.A.
