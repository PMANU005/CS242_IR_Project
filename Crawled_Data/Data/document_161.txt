She grew up in Shenstone, Staffordshire, and attended King Edward VI School, Lichfield. She wanted to be a ballet dancer when she was younger. She trained at the Elmhurst School for Dance but dropped out at 17 in favour of an acting career. She moved to the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, and then worked at the Glasgow Citizens' Theatre from 1992 to 1995. Career[edit] Television[edit] Via her work at Glasgow Citizens' Theatre, she was cast in hospital TV series Cardiac Arrest, though it was not her first television role. Her performance as Dr Claire Maitland earned her a Scottish BAFTA nomination in 1995. She was one of the stars of the popular TV series Cold Feet, playing Rachel Bradley, a role which garnered her a British Comedy Award nomination in 1997 in the pilot episode. She also starred in An Unsuitable Job for a Woman, playing Cordelia Gray. She made notable recurring appearances on the American series Friends as Ross Geller's girlfriend, wife and finally ex-wife Emily Waltham, which gave her wide exposure on American network television. She appeared in fourteen episodes throughout Season 4 and early Season 5. Other notable roles include Lorna Johnson in Truth or Dare (in which John Hannah also starred), Caroline Meagher in The Investigator (alongside Laura Fraser), and Julie Matthews in Curt Truninger's Dead by Monday. She was nominated for another Scottish BAFTA in 1997 for her role as Lorna Johnson. Dead by Monday won the Angel Award for Best Film at the Monaco International Film Festival in 2003 and the Portland Festival of World Cinema award for best feature film in 2001. She played Pandora Braithwaite in Adrian Mole: The Cappuccino Years in 2001 and "Maggie" in the multiple award-winning Bolse Vita. She also appeared in Saving Nellie, a physics programme running on Teachers TV. In 2007 to January 2008 she starred in Swimming with Sharks alongside Christian Slater at London's Vaudeville Theatre.[2] In 2008 and 2009 she has also appeared in several TV adverts for Morrisons, a British supermarket chain.[4] In January 2011, she co-starred with Trevor Eve in the three-part ITV drama Kidnap and Ransom, filmed on location in South Africa.[5] Later in the same year, she starred as DCI Marion Bettany in Val McDermid's radio crime drama Village SOS.[6] In 2010 Helen Baxendale appeared in the pilot episode of Dirk Gently as Susan Harmison. In 2012 she reprised her role in the second episode of the commissioned first and only series. She then appeared in the Inspector George Gently episode "The Lost Child" alongside Mark Gatiss. From 2012 to 2019 she starred in Cuckoo as Lorna, the mother in-law of the titular Dale 'Cuckoo' Ashbrick. Then in 2020 she played housekeeper Meggie McGregor in Noughts + Crosses. Stage[edit] On-stage, Baxendale starred as Christine in Patrick Marber's After Miss Julie, and in 2005 appeared as Romy, the eponymous title role in The Woman Before at the Royal Court alongside Nigel Lindsay, Saskia Reeves, Tom Riley and Georgia Taylor but has also played various roles including that of Ophelia in Hamlet (the Marovitz Hamlet) along with Henry Ian Cusick. For her 1993 performance in Soldiers at the Glasgow Citizens Theatre, she was nominated for an Ian Charleson Award (best classical actor under 30).[7] In 2009 Baxendale played Lara in Amongst Friends alongside Aden Gillett and Emma Cunniffe at Hampstead Theatre.[8] Radio[edit] In 2008 Baxendale appeared in one episode of BBC radio comedy Cabin Pressure. Personal life[edit] Baxendale has been with her boyfriend David L. Williams since her Glasgow days and together they have three children,[9] Her first pregnancy was written into An Unsuitable Job for a Woman and her second was written into the fourth series of Cold Feet.[9] Her first pregnancy (coupled with the fact that her country of residence was the UK, rather than the US) meant that her character was written out of Friends earlier than the writers had originally intended. Baxendale appeared in only 14 episodes, despite her character dating, marrying, and then divorcing Ross Geller (David Schwimmer), one of the show's main characters.[9][10] Filmography[edit] Film & television Year Title Role Notes 1993 The Marshal Anita Television film Euphoric Scale Short film The Good Guys Miss Lomax Episode: "All for Love" Casualty Emma Episode: "Give Us This Day" 1994–1996 Cardiac Arrest Dr. Claire Maitland 1994–1996; 27 episodes — Nominated: BAFTA Scotland Award for Best Actress in Television (1995) 1994 Love's Lost Hour Hilary Short film 1995 Dangerfield Tara 'Crystal' Jackson Episode: "The Call Girl" 1996 Crossing the Floor Ruth Clarke Television film Truth or Dare Lorna Johnston Television film — Nominated: BAFTA Scotland Award for Best Actress in Television (1997) In Suspicious Circumstances Queen Elizabeth I Episode: "An Evil Business" Bolse vita Maggie 1997–2001 An Unsuitable Job for a Woman Cordelia Gray 10 episodes 1997–2003 Cold Feet Rachel Bradley 1997 (pilot), 1998–2003 (series); 32 episodes Broadcasting Press Guild Award for Best Actress — Nominated: British Comedy Award for Best TV Comedy Actress (1997) 1997 The Investigator Sgt.
