He is of Japanese American heritage. He and his family owned Empire Egg Company, a company that distributed eggs to markets across the San Francisco Bay area. Tsujihara graduated from the University of Southern California with a bachelor's degree in accounting, and subsequently earned an MBA degree from Stanford Graduate School of Business. After graduating from Stanford, he and some former classmates launched QuickTax Inc., a tax preparation company.[1][2] Career[edit] Tsujihara joined Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc. in 1994 as the director of special projects finance, primarily dealing with the company's interest in Six Flags Theme Parks, which had been acquired by Warner Bros.' parent company Time Warner (now WarnerMedia) in 1990. While employed at Warner Bros., he also focused on business development and online content. In 2005, Tsujihara was given the position of president of the Warner Bros. Home Entertainment unit, which focuses on the home video, online distribution and video games for the company.[1][3][4] In January 2013, Tsujihara was named the new chief executive officer of Warner Bros. after the announcement that Barry Meyer would retire from the position on March 1, 2013. This made him the first Asian American to be the CEO of a major Hollywood studio and the fifth leader in the 90-year history of Warner Bros.[4][1] On March 6, 2019, there were reports that WarnerMedia was investigating allegations that Tsujihara had promised auditions and/or acting jobs to British actress Charlotte Kirk in return for sex.[5][6] On March 8, 2019, Tsujihara released a memo apologizing to his colleagues at WarnerMedia for his behavior.[7] A statement issued by Tsujihara's attorney stated that Tsujihara "did not have a direct role in the actress being cast in any movie".[8] Tsujihara resigned on March 18, 2019, as chairman and CEO of Warner Bros.[9] In September 2020, The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Tsujihara and former NBCUniversal Vice Chairman Ronald Meyer may have colluded to cover up the real nature of their relationships with Charlotte Kirk.[10] Personal life[edit] Tsujihara and his wife, Sandy, have two children.[11] Tsujihara serves on the Motion Picture & Television Fund (MPTF) Board of Governors.[12] References[edit] ^ a b c d "Petaluma native Kevin Tsujihara named CEO of Warner Bros. studio".
