When Monica realizes it is Rachel, she and Phoebe have her take an additional test to confirm it. Phoebe initially says the new test is "negative" causing Rachel to be sad and disappointed by the different result.

Sheldon Epps Sherry Bilsing & Ellen Plummer October 11, 2001 (2001-10-11) 227403 29.20[7] 15.4/34[8] Chandler and Monica are about to leave for their honeymoon as Rachel prepares to tell Ross they are having a baby. Phoebe and Joey try to get into Monica and Chandler's apartment by telling Mr. Treeger there is a gas leak. However, Treeger, who could not find the spare key, instead calls firefighters who break down the door. Note: There was a subplot of Chandler and Monica's honeymoon that was filmed but ultimately never aired. It involved Chandler joking about bombs while about to board the plane, leading Airport security to take it as a real threat and interrogating him and Monica. They are eventually determined not to be a threat, but shortly after being release, Joey calls Monica and pretends there is a gas leak in their apartment to cover for the already broken door. When Joey asked about being charged for the damaged door, she sarcastically replied, "No, I want you to stand there and wait for the entire place to blow up!", causing the authorities to re-interrogate the couple. Following the September 11 attacks, the writers felt the humor of this subplot was off color and quickly replaced it with another story about Chandler and Monica becoming jealous over another newlywed couple who got free perks by arriving just before they did. The cut scenes from this episode were later shown as a special feature on the 2004 UK version of the DVDs. 174 4 "The One with the Videotape" Kevin S.
