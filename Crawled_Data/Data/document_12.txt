His mother, Patricia (née Di Cillo), was an office manager; his father, Paul LeBlanc, was a French-Canadian mechanic.[1][2] His father is of Acadian descent and his mother is of Italian ancestry.[3] While it has been rumored frequently that LeBlanc is conversant in French due to his parentage, LeBlanc has stated in interviews with French media that he does not speak French.[4] He attended Newton North High School, where he graduated in the same year as future comedian Louis C.K.[5] After high school he attended college at Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston. He dropped out shortly after starting his second semester.[6] LeBlanc moved to New York at the age of 17 to pursue a career in modeling, but he was told he was too short to be in the industry. His acting career began after a woman invited him to accompany her to an audition, where he ended up getting signed by her manager.[7] Although he had booked commercials and television and film roles before Friends, he was reportedly down to his last eleven dollars before landing the role of Joey Tribbiani.[8] Career[edit] 1987–1994: Early career[edit] LeBlanc at the 47th Primetime Emmy Awards, 1995 LeBlanc first appeared in a 1987 Heinz Tomato Ketchup commercial. In 1988, he starred in the television drama TV 101 for one season. In 1991, he had a recurring role on the hit Fox sitcom Married... with Children. He played Vinnie Verducci, a family friend of protagonist Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill) who briefly dates his daughter, Kelly (Christina Applegate). He also guest-starred in the first season of Red Shoe Diaries. LeBlanc went on to star in two short-lived Married... with Children spin-offs: Top of the Heap (1991) and Vinnie & Bobby (1992). He appeared in two Bon Jovi music videos: "Miracle," from the Young Guns II soundtrack in 1990, and "Say It Isn't So" in 2000.[9] He also appeared in videos for Alanis Morissette's single "Walk Away," Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' "Into the Great Wide Open," and Bob Seger's "Night Moves."[10] 1994–2004: Friends[edit] LeBlanc found success as the dimwitted but lovable Joey Tribbiani on Friends; he played this character for 12 years — 10 seasons of Friends and two seasons of Joey. Friends was wildly successful, and LeBlanc (along with co-stars Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox-Arquette, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer) gained wide recognition among viewers. This ensemble situation comedy became a major hit for NBC, airing on Thursday nights for ten years.[11] For his performance, LeBlanc received three Primetime Emmy Award nominations, three Golden Globe award nominations, and one Screen Actors Guild Award nomination. During this time he also appeared in the films Lookin' Italian (1994), Ed (1996), Lost in Space (1998), Charlie's Angels (2000), and its sequel, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (2003). 2006–2011: Hiatus[edit] Following the cancellation of Joey, Matt LeBlanc announced that he would be taking a one-year hiatus from acting on television, which eventually turned into five years.[12] 2011–present: Career revival[edit] LeBlanc at the Golden Globes with Meryl Streep, 2012 From 2011, LeBlanc appeared as a fictionalized version of himself in Episodes, a television series about an American remake of a fictional British television series.[13][14] The series is written by Friends co-creator David Crane and his partner Jeffrey Klarik.[15] At the 69th Golden Globe Awards in 2012, LeBlanc won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a television series, musical, or comedy, and was nominated for an additional four Primetime Emmy Awards.[16] In February 2012, LeBlanc appeared in the second episode of the eighteenth series of Top Gear, where he set the fastest lap time in the "Star in a Reasonably Priced Car" segment in a Kia Cee'd. Lapping at 1:42.1, he beat the show's previous record-holder, Rowan Atkinson, by 0.1 seconds.[10] He also appeared in the fourth episode of the nineteenth season to race the New Kia Cee'd, and beat his previous time. In February 2016, the BBC announced LeBlanc had signed on to become one of the new Top Gear hosts,[17] signing a two-year deal later that year.[18] He announced his decision to retire from the series in May 2018, having co-hosted it for three years. Despite the show being "great fun", he stated the "time commitment and extensive travel takes me away from my family and friends more than I'm comfortable with."[19] LeBlanc played the lead role in the CBS sitcom Man with a Plan, which began airing in 2016 until it was cancelled in 2020.[20] Personal life[edit] Le Blanc has an extensive interests in cars, and worked as a carpenter before acting.[21] He married Melissa McKnight, a British-born American model and a divorced single mother of two children, in May 2003.[22] In 1997, they were introduced to each other by McKnight's friend, Kelly Phillips (wife of actor Lou Diamond Phillips). LeBlanc proposed to her a year later.[22] Their daughter, Marina, born in 2004, began suffering seizures at eight months old. By the time she was two years old, the condition, thought to be a form of dysplasia, had mostly subsided.[22][23] LeBlanc and McKnight divorced in October 2006, citing irreconcilable differences.[24] Filmography[edit] Film[edit] Year Title Role Notes 1987 Doll Day Afternoon GI Joe Film debut, short film 1990 Jon Bon Jovi: Miracle Friend Music video, short video 1991 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers: Into the Great Wide Open Young man 1993 Grey Knight Terhue 1993 Red Shoe Diaries 3: Another Woman's Lipstick Kyle Segment: "Just Like That" 1994 Bob Seger: Night Moves Young man Music video, short video 1994 Lookin' Italian Anthony Manetti 1995 Friends Joey Tribbiani Music video, video short 1996 Ed Jack 'Deuce’ Cooper 1997 Red Shoe Diaries 7: Burning Up Jed Segment: "Kidnap" 1998 Lost in Space Major Don West 2000 Bon Jovi: Say It Isn't So Unknown Music video, short video 2000 Charlie's Angels Jason Gibbs 2001 All the Queen's Men O'Rourke 2003 Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle Jason Gibbs 2010 Jonah Hex N/A Executive producer 2014 Lovesick Charlie Darby Television[edit] Year Title Role Notes 1988–1989 TV 101 Chuck Bender Series regular (13 episodes) 1989 Just the Ten of Us Todd Murphy 2 episodes 1990 Anything to Survive Billy Burton Television movie 1990 Monsters Tommy Episode: "Shave and a Haircut, Two Bites" 1991 Top of the Heap Vinnie Verducci Recurring role (7 episodes) 1991 Married... with Children 4 episodes 1992–1993 Vinnie & Bobby Series regular (7 episodes) 1992–1993 Red Shoe Diaries Tom's Brother, Jed Cody/Kyle 2 episodes 1993 Class of '96 Frank Goodman Episode: "Bright Smoke, Cold Fire" 1994 Reform School Girl Vince Television movie 1994–2004 Friends Joey Tribbiani Main cast (236 episodes) 2004–2006 Joey Main cast (46 episodes) 2011–2017 Episodes Matt LeBlanc Main cast (41 episodes) 2012 Top Gear Himself (guest) 1 episode 2013 Web Therapy Nick Jericho Web series; 3 episodes 2013 Web Therapy Television series; 2 episodes 2015 The Prince Television movie; Producer 2016–2019 Top Gear Himself (presenter) 24 episodes (series 23, 24, 25, 26) 2016–2020 Man with a Plan Adam Burns Main cast (69 episodes); Executive producer 2021 Friends: The Reunion Himself HBO Max special; Executive producer[25] 2021 Top Gear: A Tribute to Sabine Schmitz Himself 1 episode Awards and nominations[edit] Main article: List of awards and nominations received by Matt LeBlanc References[edit] ^ Tauber, Michelle (May 19, 2003).
