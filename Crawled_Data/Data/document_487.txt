Starring: Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, Lisa Kudrow Summary: "With a Little Help From My Friends" is a song written by the Beatles (and expertly covered by Joe Cocker) and it could easily be the subtitle for the thirty minute comedy, "Friends". In 1994, the idea was created for "Friends": a show about six friends in New York as they navigate their way through life and learn to grow up as they approach the third decade of their life. All, with the help from each other to get them through the obstacles that life naturally has for us. Monica is the excessively neat and organized "older sister" of the group, who works as a chef while yearning to find her ideal love. Ross, Monica's older brother, is a paleontologist with a lifelong crush on Rachel. He is a laid-back man with low self esteem and a recent divorcee. Rachel is the pretty, bubbly girl who spent most of her life as a spoiled rich princess. Now she must learn to face the real world. Chandler is Ross' college buddy and the guy who will crack jokes at a moment's notice. Phoebe is a lovable eccentric masseuse who easily could have fit in with Haight Ashbury in the 1960s. And Joey, the friend who has an inverse relationship between his good looks and his intelligence. He dreams of becoming an actor. These six individuals make up the cast of Friends. In May 2004, Friends officially ended it's phenomenal 10 year run. The show's time slot was taken over by a spin-off called Joey.… Expand Genre(s): Comedy Show Type: Ended Season 1 premiere date: Sep 22, 1994 Episode Length: 30 Air Time: 08:00 PM More Details and Credits » Critic Reviews Score distribution: Positive: 9 out of 20 Mixed: 8 out of 20 Negative: 3 out of 20 Entertainment Weekly Reviewed by: Ken Tucker Jun 11, 2013 91 At its best, Friends operates like a first-rate Broadway farce, complete with slamming doors, twisty plots, and intricately strung together jokes. And even when it's not at its best, the crack acting and piquant punchlines give Friends a momentum and charm that win you over even if you're not laughing.

[22 Sept 1994, p.1D] All this critic's reviews Chicago Tribune Reviewed by: Ken Parish Perkins Feb 27, 2013 80 What helps Friends is that the show's creators have come up with a highly likable group of actors who are talented and charming, if not rip-roaringly funny. [21 Sept 1994, p.C2] All this publication's reviews Variety Reviewed by: Tony Scott Feb 27, 2013 60 Concept is OK, but the humor's less sophisticated than expected from the exec producers of HBO's comedy series "Dream On," and the dialogue is not exactly snappy. Ross: "I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny!" Chandler: "Stay out of my freezer." All this publication's reviews Read full review San Diego Union-Tribune Reviewed by: Robert P. Laurence Feb 27, 2013 50 Tonight's new NBC sitcom from the producers of HBO's "Dream On" hands us still one more batch of self-consciously quirky, single, more-or-less charming twentysomething characters and lets them hang for a half-hour reading faux Woody Allen lines. [22 Sept 1994, p.36] All this critic's reviews Miami Herald Reviewed by: Hal Boedeker Feb 27, 2013 50 Wildly uneven. [22 Sept 1994] All this publication's reviews Washington Post Reviewed by: Tom Shales Feb 27, 2013 0 Friends comes across like a 30-minute commercial for Dockers or Ikea or light beer, except it's smuttier. One character says he dreamed he had a telephone for a penis and when it rang, "it turns out it's my mother." And this is in the first five minutes...Another ghastly creation from professional panderers Marta Kauffman and David Crane, the witless duo who do "Dream On" for HBO, Friends is more a scripted talk show than a sitcom. You keep waiting for Sally Jessy or some other cluck to interrupt the jabbering. The show is so bad that Sally Jessy would actually come as a relief.

Priceless and genius. Is one of the few shows where I don't care what episode or season I watch. I can just close my eye's and pick a disk from my collection and watch it.

The humor is more goofy than smart like in the later seasons. It also feels like they are trying to hard to get young people to watch it.
