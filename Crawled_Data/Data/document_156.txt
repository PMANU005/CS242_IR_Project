Career[edit] Between 1994 and 1995, Brewster hosted a late-night talk show in the San Francisco Bay Area called Paget for 65 episodes at KPIX-TV.[8] She first came to prominent attention in her recurring role as Kathy in the fourth season of NBC's Friends. She appeared in Andy Richter Controls the Universe and Huff. On film she played Ms. Indestructible, the female lead in James Gunn's low-budget superhero comedy The Specials (2000). She played Amy Pierson, a calculus teacher afraid of the water, in the independent film The Big Bad Swim, which premiered at the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival. In 2005, she began voice work as Judy Sebben/Birdgirl, a recurring character on the animated series Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law (and later played a similar guest character on American Dad!). Brewster (front center) with the cast of Criminal Minds Brewster had a long run with the show Criminal Minds, playing multilingual Supervisory Special Agent Emily Prentiss until the show's sixth season, when she and A. J. Cook were released from their contracts by CBS in a cost-cutting move. Owing to complaints from fans, both she and Cook were rehired and kept for the following season. In February 2012, Brewster announced via Deadline that she was leaving Criminal Minds at the end of the season to return to her comedic and sitcom roots.[9] Brewster reprised her role as Emily Prentiss in season nine for the 200th episode, and season 11 as a special guest star.[10] In 2016, Brewster returned to Criminal Minds once again as a series regular. Brewster subsequently portrayed bureau chief PDA Paula Foster in the Public Integrity Unit of the District Attorney's office on NBC's long-running police drama Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Her character handled the case against SVU commanding officer Captain Donald Cragen (Dann Florek), suspected of murder after awakening next to a dead woman in the 13th-season finale.[11][12][13] Brewster was a regular on The Thrilling Adventure Hour, a staged production in the style of old-time radio that was recorded monthly at Largo in Los Angeles. She played the recurring character of Sadie Doyle, the alcoholic socialite who can communicate with the supernatural alongside her husband, Frank (Paul F. Tompkins), in the "Beyond Belief" segments. In early April 2013, Brewster appeared in Modern Family as Trish in episode 20, "Flip Flop", playing an art expert who is dating Gloria's ex-husband, Javier. In August 2013, Brewster appeared in episode 106 of the Drunk History television series on Comedy Central. In January 2015, Brewster began appearing on Community. In February 2014, it was announced that she had been cast in a new ABC comedy called St. Francis. In August 2016, it was announced that she would be reprising her role as Emily Prentiss on Criminal Minds and would once again be a series regular. Brewster also regularly appears on Will You Accept This Rose, a Nerdist podcast hosted by Arden Myrin about The Bachelor franchise. Personal life[edit] On the March 30, 2006, episode of Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Brewster revealed that she had received a handwritten note indicating Hugh Hefner would like her to pose for Playboy. She seriously considered the offer, but even though she said that she admired Playboy more than magazines such as Maxim and FHM, and her parents gave her their blessing, she eventually turned it down.[14] She has volunteered as an actress with the Los Angeles Young Storytellers Program.[15] On March 17, 2013, Brewster became engaged to Steve Damstra, a member of the bands Folded Light and Whirlwind Heat.[16][17] Brewster and Damstra married on November 28, 2014, in Los Angeles, in a ceremony officiated by Matthew Gray Gubler, their close friend and Brewster's Criminal Minds co-star.[18][19] As of 2016[update], the couple resides in Los Angeles.[20] Filmography[edit] Film[edit] Year Title Role Notes 1998 Let's Talk About Sex Michelle 1999 Desperate But Not Serious Frances 2000 The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle Jenny Spy The Specials Emily Tilderbrook / Ms. Indestructible 2001 Agent 15 Agent 15 Short film Hollywood Palms Phoebe Skippy Julie Fontaine 2002 Now You Know Lea 2003 Brainwarp Lipstikk Short film 2004 Eulogy Aunt Lily 2005 Man of the House Coach 'Binky' Beauregard My Big Fat Independent Movie Julianne 2006 Cyxork 7 Bethany Feral The Big Bad Swim Amy Pierson Kidney Thieves Melinda Short film Unaccompanied Minors Valerie Davenport 2007 Sublime Andrea Direct-to-video 2012 Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Lana Lang (voice) 2014 Gumshoe Stiletto (voice) Short film 2015 Justice League: Gods and Monsters Lois Lane (voice) Uncle Nick Sophie Welcome to Happiness Priscilla 2017 Axis Dr. Lynch (voice) Batman and Harley Quinn Poison Ivy (voice) Direct-to-video 2018 The Witch Files Detective Strauss Also producer 2022 Hypocondriac Dr. Sampson Television[edit] Year Title Role Notes 1997–1998 Friends Kathy 6 episodes, Guest role (Season 4) 1998 Ghost Cop Anette Episode: "Pilot" Max Q Rena Winter Television film 1998–2001 Godzilla: The Series Audrey Timmonds (voice) Seasons 1–2 (11 episodes) 1999 The Expert Dr. Jo Hardy Episode: "Pilot" 1999–2000 Love & Money Allison Conklin Season 1 (13 episodes) 2000 Star Patrol Rachel Striker Pilot One True Love Tina Television film 2000–01 The Trouble With Normal Claire Garletti Season 1 (13 episodes) 2001 DAG Patti Donovan Episode: "Prom" Raising Dad Gracie Episode: "Sex Ed" 2002 George Lopez Ginger Episode: "The Wedding Dance" 2002–03 Andy Richter Controls the Universe Jessica Green Seasons 1–2 (19 episodes) 2003 The Snobs Pilot Time Belt Col.
