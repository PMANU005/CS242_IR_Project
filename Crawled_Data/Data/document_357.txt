Contents 1 History 2 Logos 3 Programs 4 References 5 External links History[edit] Sony Channel was launched in August 1995 as Sony Entertainment Television, a basic cable television channel. In Mexico it was first available on Televisa's Cablevisión cable TV system in March 1996 followed by its launch in Brazil that same year. Unlike most television networks in Latin America, which air all imported shows dubbed in Spanish or Portuguese, Sony started airing its programming with dubbed which led to its role as a regional TV leader. In 2011, the Sony Pictures channels in Brazil gained greater autonomy from the Spanish-language feeds,[1] and as part of that, it was announced that CSI: Crime Scene Investigation would return to Canal Sony in Brazil, while in the rest of the region, that show remained airing on AXN. In October 2011, CSI: Miami was picked up by Sony Channel Brazil. In 2015, HBO Latin America (now Ole Distribution) switched from subtitles to dubbing in most of its channels, including Sony and AXN, which has caused some criticism among viewers.[2][3] The networks appeal to its users to use the channel's SAP audio track in order to view programming in its original language.
