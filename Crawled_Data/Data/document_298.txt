External links Website The Ellen DeGeneres Show (often shortened to Ellen and stylized as ellen) is an American daytime television variety comedy talk show created and hosted by its namesake Ellen DeGeneres. Debuting on September 8, 2003, it is produced by Telepictures and airs in syndication. The majority of stations owned by NBC Owned Television Stations, along with Hearst Television and Tegna, serve as the program's largest affiliate base.[2] For its first five seasons, the show was taped in Studio 11 at NBC Studios in Burbank, California. From season 6 onwards, the show moved to being taped at Stage 1 on the nearby Warner Bros. lot.[3] Since the beginning of the sixth season, The Ellen DeGeneres Show has been broadcast in high definition. The show has received 171 Daytime Emmy Award nominations and has won 61 Daytime Emmy Awards as of 2021, including four for Outstanding Talk Show and seven for Outstanding Talk Show Entertainment, making 11 total awards and surpassing the record held by The Oprah Winfrey Show, which won nine as Outstanding Talk Show before it was divided into two categories (Informative and Entertainment) in 2008. The show also won 17 People's Choice Awards. On May 21, 2019, DeGeneres announced she had signed for three more years, renewing the show through 2022.[4][5][6][7] The eighteenth season premiered on September 21, 2020.[8] On May 12, 2021, DeGeneres announced that the nineteenth season is set to be her last.[9] The nineteenth and final season premiered on September 13, 2021.[10] Contents 1 Concept 1.1 Recurring elements 1.1.1 Segments (including former and recurring) 1.1.2 Dancing 1.1.3 Sophia Grace and Rosie 2 Production information 2.1 Taping location 2.2 Personnel 2.2.1 DJ 2.3 2007 Writers Guild strike 2.4 COVID-19 pandemic 2.5 Controversy over work culture 2.6 Ending 3 Episodes 3.1 Special episodes 3.2 Guest hosts 4 Home media 5 Social media 6 Reception 6.1 Ratings 6.2 Awards 7 Spin-offs 7.1 Ellen's Game of Games 7.2 Ellen's Greatest Night of Giveaways 7.3 The Masked Dancer 7.4 Family Game Fight! 8 References 9 External links Concept[edit] The program combines comedy, celebrity, musical guests, and human-interest stories. The program often features audience participation games where prizes are awarded. During her Twelve Days of Giveaways promotion, audience members receive roughly $3,000 worth of prizes on each of twelve episodes. Because the show has become so popular, not all who arrive hoping to see a taping can fit into the studio, so an offshoot space, dubbed by Tom Hanks "The Riff Raff Room", was created. People seated here are often referenced and shown briefly on camera but watch the taping from off-stage. Other non-celebrities have been featured in an attempt by DeGeneres to give them 15 minutes of fame. Guests in this role have included intelligent children, small business owners, etc. In the show's third season, DeGeneres began surprising fans by introducing them to their favorite celebrities. Recurring elements[edit] Ellen DeGeneres in 2004 Several recurring sounds, gags, and catchphrases are used by DeGeneres depending on the topic of discussion or theme for a specific episode. For example, after DeGeneres says the phrase, "Aww Snap!", a sound effect of a whip cracking often is played. In her monologue, DeGeneres frequently thanks the audience's applause by saying "I feel the same way about you!" Other video segments include DeGeneres scaring people, playing pranks, taking part in faux-breaking news segments, interacting with crew members, etc. Other recurring segments include those where DeGeneres comments on Internet videos, tabloid-style photographs of celebrities, advertisements on Craigslist, or voicemails left for her on an answering machine. Some segments feature audience members more prominently, including having audience members show hidden talents, pictures of others that resemble DeGeneres, interviewing children, etc. DeGeneres frequently plays games with audience members and awards prizes based upon their performance. Games have included Pictionary-style drawing games, finding hidden objects within the studio, category, current event or pop-culture-based trivia, and various other stunt and charade-based games. DeGeneres also joked several times on the show about when a sequel to Finding Nemo, in which she famously had a lead role, would eventually release, as well as make references to the film. Eventually, the sequel, Finding Dory, was officially announced by DeGeneres. Segments (including former and recurring)[edit] The show has many recurring segments throughout the years. Some include: Oh Hair No! is a segment that involves fans sending DeGeneres pictures of their funny haircuts, some of which appear on the show. Know or Go is a segment involving three audience members (as contestants) who answer questions based on different topics such as Thanksgiving, current events.

"Celebrity Pranks!" is a segment in which Ellen often pulls a prank or scares celebrity guests, although she once pranked a pair of best friends she brought on the show (one posted a video of scaring the other every day for a year). Although any celebrity can fall victim to it at any time, some have fallen for it often including Taylor Swift, Eric Stonestreet, Sarah Paulson, and Selena Gomez, who have each fallen for it at least five times over multiple appearances. On several occasions, the celebrity is pranked more than once during the same show (Octavia Spencer and Sam Smith as well as the previously mentioned ones). Some pranks include (but are not limited to) scaring guests in the dressing room (usually the bathroom), having a staff member or another celebrity scare them onstage during the interview (using various methods ranging from simple to inventive), or backstage shenanigans where her own staff, particularly Andy Lassner, are frequent victims as well. On occasion the prank fails to scare the intended target, usually prompting a wisecrack from Ellen (e.g. Russell Crowe, Colin Farrell, Daniel Radcliffe, and Garth Brooks). Ellen herself is an occasional target but has proven to be very difficult to pull a prank on with only two celebrities (Steve Carell and Matt Lauer) being the only ones to successfully prank her as of April 2021. "Chat Time With Ellen!" is a talk-show segment in which Ellen talks about—or to—people who have made viral videos. Can Andy Say That? is a segment in which Ellen has the show's executive producer, Andy Lassner, repeat funny phrases that are filled with double entendres and sexual innuendo. Haunted House (the segment is actually untitled) is an annual segment in which Ellen sends her writer, Amy Rhodes, to various haunted houses in the days leading up to Halloween. In later years, Amy was joined in the haunted houses by her own mother, as well as the show's executive producer Andy Lassner. After Andy's stint going through with Amy, Ellen has made him go through every year, replacing Amy after she left the show. He's been joined by other Ellen staff members as well as celebrities like Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift, Eric Stonestreet, Sarah Paulson, and DeGeneres's wife Portia de Rossi (as well as others) have also been sent to a haunted house. In one instance, Ellen herself joined Andy and went through a haunted house based on the 2017 film It. On other occasions some of Ellen's staff (Integrations Assistant Mackenzie, producer Matt Wright) went through without Andy. Ellen has occasionally sent celebrities on their own as well (Katie Lowes and Guillermo Diaz for example). Average Andy is a segment in which Ellen sends her executive producer Andy Lassner to learn new skills from the world's most talented people. Throwback Thursday is a segment in which every Thursday Ellen revisits funny moments from previous seasons. "Who's In My Bushes?" is a segment in which a celebrity is hidden in decorative bushes in which Ellen will ask questions to that celebrity and eventually comes out when figured. However, during this segment, Ellen already knows who the celebrity is and the audience will just play along.

Breaking News is a segment in which news anchor Devin Scillian interrupts the show and delivers unusually mundane, humorous breaking news. Why I Don't Have Kids is a segment in which Ellen shows pictures or videos sent in by viewers of crazy situations they have encountered with their kids. Epic or Fail is a segment considered to be Ellen's favorite game, in which Ellen shows several stunts or tricks caught on tape, and when the videos are paused, Ellen, the audience, guest celebrities and Twitch have to guess the ending's outcome. Hot Hands is a game in which some audience member or celebrities get on a special seat and name the celebrities which are shown on the screen as much as possible in 30 seconds. 5 Second Rule is a game in which Ellen and celebrity contestants have to think on their feet and list three answers that fall into a given category in only five seconds.

What's In The Box? is a segment in which Ellen gives out gifts through boxes, curtains and small games such as three-card monte. Gifts can include iPads, watches and even holidays Hubba Hubba Quiz Quiz is a segment in which Ellen questions men. Don't Leave Me Hanging is a game in which Ellen questions people. If they get a strike, they get lifted into the air. If they get three strikes, they get lifted all the way to the top. Ellen, Rate My Baby is a segment in which Ellen rates pictures of babies sent in by her viewers from a scale of 1-10 (She goes over 10, e.g. 17/10) Make it Rain is a game in which two (usually male) celebrities have to answer questions. If they answer correctly they get a chance to stand under one of several umbrellas and pull a string. One of the umbrellas releases money, which goes to a charity of the winner's choice. The other umbrellas release water, which ends up making the celebrity wet. Me Me Monday is a segment in which Ellen shows a collection of funny memes and comments on them. Danger Word is a word association game reminiscent of Password, where audience members must guess a word from clues without saying the titular "danger word" (such as "cereal" being the danger word for "Cheerios"). If the player guesses the winning word, the opponent gets a strike and gets sprayed by one of the cannons. If a person guesses the danger word, that person gets a strike and gets sprayed. Thank GIF It's Friday is a segment in which Ellen shows GIF's that people post on the Internet. She shows these on Fridays. One-Eyed Monster is a game in which two player took turns entering the monster's mouth where they will be questioned by Ellen. The answer itself ranged from 0 to 5. For each number the contestant is off, he or she must pull one of the monster's teeth. However, one of the monster's teeth will cause the monster jaws to snap shut. The Masked Dancer is a segment spoofing the series The Masked Singer (to which Ellen notes that Fox had not sued her yet), where Ellen and tWitch attempt to guess the identity of a mystery guest concealed with a costume mask. Actual Masked Singer panelist Ken Jeong made an appearance as a guest judge on one episode. In January 2020, it was announced that Fox and Warner Bros. would produce The Masked Dancer as an actual spin-off of The Masked Singer, with DeGeneres as executive producer.[12][13] Burning Questions is a game where a celebrity guest sits in a chair in front of a buzzer while Ellen asks them a slew of personal (sometimes embarrassing) questions. The celebrity hits the buzzer when they answer the question.[14] Heads Up! Heads Up! is a game that DeGeneres plays with other celebrities. Originally, the game had players guess words or phrases on physical cards held to their foreheads by watching the other players act it out or give hints as time counted down. Later, DeGeneres and Warner Bros. Entertainment developed an app version of the game. The app became a huge success after its May 2013 launch, rising to the top of the App Store with over 650,000 downloads during its first month. By July 2016, it had been downloaded more than 25 million times and remained one of Apple's top-paid apps.[15] Dancing[edit] Michelle Obama and Ellen dance on the second anniversary of Let's Move! Since the show's debut, DeGeneres has segued from her opening monologue by doing a dance. The dancing proved to be extremely popular with viewers, and has since progressed to a segment where DeGeneres dances into the audience, sometimes borrowing a coat or purse from someone's chair, and taking it with her. She has also featured a segment in which people teach her new dance moves. One of her most famous dance moves is dancing over the table, where she straddles the coffee table and dances from one end to the other. Although she does not do it every day, dancing over the table is a recurring theme. As an April Fools' Day prank in 2009, the show's staff placed a wider table top over her normal table. During the show, when DeGeneres attempted to dance over it, she barely made it across, being forced on her tip-toes and using the table as leverage. On the seventh-season premiere, DeGeneres performed a dance segment with the cast of So You Think You Can Dance. In September 2009, four major record labels sued the producers of the show for unspecified damages over the dance routine, for allegedly using songs without permission.[16] In 2018 The New York Times profiled DeGeneres as she faced decisions of renewing her talkshow contract, and exploring other outlets for her creativity including her Netflix comedy special Relatable (2018), which spoofs her kind image.[17] They noted she felt boxed in with a reputation of always being nice, and the host who danced all time.[17] DeGeneres—who acknowledges she has always been over-sensitive—fretted how her audience would react when she no longer wanted to dance.[17] Her Christian Scientist upbringing included her father's psyche, “He was a very fearful man, he couldn't hear or engage with anything unpleasant.”[17] Sophia Grace and Rosie[edit] Main article: Sophia Grace & Rosie Sophia Grace Brownlee (born April 18, 2003[18]) and her cousin Rosie McClelland (born September 7, 2006[19]) were first invited to the show after DeGeneres saw their YouTube video cover of "Super Bass" by Nicki Minaj, which Sophia Grace and Rosie posted on YouTube on September 19, 2011.[20] The then eight- and five-year-old Essex, England natives became recurring cast members on the show, where they hosted their own segment called "Tea Time with Sophia Grace and Rosie". In the segment, the duo invites and interviews guest celebrities such as Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Hugh Grant, Julie Bowen, Harry Connick Jr., LL Cool J, Justin Bieber, and Reese Witherspoon over to tea. Sophia Grace and Rosie won the "Choice Webstar" at the 2012 Teen Choice Awards for this segment. They have also been correspondents during the red carpet events such as the Grammy Awards, the American Music Awards, the Billboard Music Awards, and the MTV Video Music Awards. They appeared in the third episode (June 2013) and the eleventh episode (September 2013) of Sam & Cat. According to her representative, Sophia Grace had been cast as Little Red Riding Hood in Walt Disney Pictures' film adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's Into the Woods, but she withdrew before production.[21] Sophia Grace and Rosie starred in their own movie called Sophia Grace and Rosie's Royal Adventure. Production information[edit] Taping location[edit] From 2003 to early 2008, the program was originally taped in Studio 11 at NBC Studios in Burbank, California. It is now filmed in Studio 1 (named "The Ellen Stage" since her 2,000th show, which took place in November 2015) on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank. Personnel[edit] The executive producers are DeGeneres, Mary Connelly, Ed Glavin, Andy Lassner, and (until his death in 2012) Jim Paratore. The writing staff has included Karen Kilgariff (former head writer), Karen Anderson, Margaret Smith, and DeGeneres. Margaret Smith left the show to work on her own projects, including her first book, What Was I Thinking? How Being a Stand Up Did Nothing to Prepare Me to Become a Single Mother (Crossroad Publishing, 2008). Amy Rhodes, a former writer for the program, regularly appeared on camera during various segments. DJ[edit] Unlike most talk shows, the show uses a disc jockey to supply music rather than a band. Originally, the role was filled by Los Angeles-based DJ Scott K, who lasted only a few weeks. He was later replaced by Tony Okungbowa, who DJed through season 3. Due to his growing acting career, Okungbowa left the show, and a few guest DJs were brought in to try out for the position. Tony was replaced by actor/DJ Jon Abrahams for the fourth-season premiere. Abrahams stayed on the show for one season, and also left as his acting career grew. Ted Stryker of KROQ, was the DJ for the fifth season. Stryker stayed for one season until Okungbowa returned. In a 2012 episode, DJ Pauly D from Jersey Shore deejayed when Okungbowa was promoting his CD. Starting in season 11, several episodes include celebrity "guest DJs" filling the DJ position in Okungbowa's absence. Stephen "tWitch" Boss of So You Think You Can Dance fame has been Ellen's permanent DJ for several years. Okungbowa made a return appearance on the show in the April 28, 2014 episode, while Loni made a return in the June 5, 2015 episode.[citation needed] 2007 Writers Guild strike[edit] DeGeneres, a member of the Writers Guild of America, supported the 2007 writers' strike.[22] However, on November 9, 2007, DeGeneres crossed the picket line to tape more episodes of her TV show stating: It was explained to me that no other daytime shows have shut down. I've got 135 employees that rely on me for a paycheck. But it's been the hardest thing in the world driving onto this lot.[22] DeGeneres decided to abstain from doing a monologue on her show (which is typically written by WGA writers) during the strike.[23] Her show continued production as normal with the exception of her monologue being omitted. The WGAE issued a statement condemning DeGeneres, stating she was "not welcome in NY."[24] DeGeneres's representatives asserted that she did not violate the WGA's agreement, arguing that she is competing with other first-run syndicated shows like Dr. Phil and Live with Regis and Kelly during the competitive November sweeps period, and that DeGeneres must fulfill her duties as host and producer, lest her show lose its time slot or be held in breach of contract. In addition, a statement defending DeGeneres was subsequently issued by AFTRA, pointing out that DeGeneres also works under the AFTRA TV Code, which bars her from striking. The WGAE then issued a response pointing out that DeGeneres is also a Writers Guild member, and that any writing work she did on her show during the strike constituted struck work.[25][26] COVID-19 pandemic[edit] On March 11, 2020, DeGeneres announced via Twitter that for now she would be shooting her show without a studio audience to protect the health and safety of the fans, staff, and crew.[27] In a tweet dated March 13, 2020, DeGeneres announced that production of the show had been suspended until March 30, 2020, to protect the health of her audience and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic.[28] Starting on April 6, 2020, the show was produced from her home.[citation needed] On April 16, 2020, Variety reported that crew members had accused the show of not communicating about their pay during the pandemic-induced shutdown.[29] Controversy over work culture[edit] In 2018 The New York Times profiled Degeneres as she faced decisions of renewing her talk show contract, and exploring other outlets for her creativity including her Netflix comedy special Relatable (2018), which spoofed her kind public image.[17] When asked about anonymous tabloid reports that she is not always nice to her workers, she said the accusations were false, saying, “The one thing I want is for everyone to be happy and proud of where they work, and if not, don't work here.”[17] In July 2020, BuzzFeed News ran articles in which anonymous former employees accused the show of being a toxic workplace, accused the executive producers of harassment, as well as alleging an atmosphere with racist comments and microaggressions.[30][31] WarnerMedia began an investigation.[32] DeGeneres apologized to her staff, writing that “she intended for her show to be a place where ‘no one would ever raise their voice, and everyone would be treated with respect’ and that she was ‘disappointed to learn that this has not been the case.’”[33][34] Following the investigation, three executives were fired, executive producers Ed Glavin and Kevin Leman, and co-executive producer Jonathan Norman.[35] The show vowed to take steps to change the culture; DeGeneres apologized again during the eighteenth season’s September 2020 opening.[36] Her DJ, Stephen "tWitch" Boss, was promoted to co-executive producer and has served as host for the show filling in for DeGeneres. Ending[edit] On May 19, 2021, shortly after the controversy, DeGeneres confirmed that the show would conclude at the end of the 2021–22 season, the show's nineteenth, coinciding with the end of her current contract.[9] Warner Bros. was not initially expected to offer a direct replacement program, and current lead carrier NBC Owned Television Stations has announced it will move The Kelly Clarkson Show, which is produced by sister company NBCUniversal Syndication Studios, into the Ellen timeslot on its stations.[37] Other stations will make individual decisions about replacement programming, and some may fill the timeslot with local news programming, though a few had indicated interest in the possibility of a show hosted by frequent Ellen fill-in host Tiffany Haddish.[38] In November 2021, Deadline reported that Warner Bros. was in discussions with local station groups about a potential new daytime talk show hosted by Jennifer Hudson that could launch as soon as fall 2022, which the studio foresees as a "successor" to Ellen, notwithstanding the prior announcement by the NBC-owned stations.[39] Episodes[edit] As of January 3, 2022,[update] 3,193 episodes of The Ellen DeGeneres Show have aired.

Other recurring themes feature products from sponsors DeGeneres likes (similar to Oprah's Favorite Things from the now ended The Oprah Winfrey Show), specials following awards show telecasts (such as the Academy Awards), and numerous milestone episodes (e.g., DeGeneres's 1,000th, 1,300th, 1,500th, etc. broadcasts). In 2017, an episode aired commemorating the 20th anniversary of "The Puppy Episode," the episode of her sitcom Ellen, in which her character Ellen Morgan came out as a lesbian. The episode titled "Sirdeaner Walker Interview" was nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for "Outstanding Talk Show Episode" during the 21st GLAAD Media Awards.[40] On January 11, 2013, DeGeneres announced that she was going to Australia in March with her wife, Australian actress Portia de Rossi, after having wanted to go for many years, being unable to visit in summer (which she preferred) due to taping conflicts of her show.[41] Toward the end of the episode, which featured Nicole Kidman as a guest, she announced to the audience that they will also be going on a holiday to Australia in a giveaway special. On March 3, 2014, DeGeneres hosted the show live, one day after her being the host of the 86th Academy Awards. This episode features that year's Oscar winners Cate Blanchett, Jared Leto, and Lupita Nyong'o as guests. Guest hosts[edit] From time to time a guest host fills in for DeGeneres. This was previously quite rare, but gradually became more common, especially in recent seasons, and is now considered a regular part of the show. Ellie Kemper filled in to be the first guest host on the show on January 24, 2014, as Ellen was unable to host the show due to having the flu.[42] Kemper hosted for a second time on December 24, 2018.[43] She hosted for a third time on December 23, 2019. Miley Cyrus hosted on September 29, 2016, which was also day four of the 7th Annual Cat Week, as Ellen was sick.[44] Sean Hayes hosted on May 30, 2018[45] while Ellen was in Africa visiting the gorillas in Rwanda to help with the Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Camp.
