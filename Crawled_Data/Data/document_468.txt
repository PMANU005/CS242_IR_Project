Photo: Reuters Budding sitcom makers are learning from a master, writes Suzanne C. Ryan. KEVIN BRIGHT, FOR 10 years an executive producer of the megahit Friends, has a lot of strong opinions about what's wrong with television sitcoms today. "We're in a bad place," he maintains. "Since Will & Grace, I haven't seen one original idea on network TV." But rather than go on about his share of the blame - his Friends spin-off Joey was cancelled eight months ago - Bright prefers to fix things by instructing a new generation of sitcom makers in the art of what's funny. The director and producer has returned to his alma mater, Emerson College, as a visiting professor. "I want to get back to people who love television, instead of dealing with people who are trying to make money off of it," says the 1976 graduate and member of the Emerson board of trustees. "I still have an agent. I've still been getting scripts. But I'm going to be very particular about my next project. I'm in a very blessed place. I can work, or not." For now, the professor is consumed teaching a course on directing comedy for television. He's also serving as faculty adviser for two sketch comedy pilots being developed for Emerson's TV outlet, the Emerson Channel. "We're doing two shows with a $14,000 budget," he says. "This doesn't pay for lunch for my crew in Los Angeles but that's what they have, so we're making it work." The college students cannot believe their luck. "Kevin wants people to ask questions," says student Joseph Mancuso, 21. "At first, I didn't want to say the wrong thing. Now I know, if you work hard, he will help you get to the next level. I'm going to Emerson's Los Angeles campus next semester and I hope to stay in touch with him. I hope to work with him again." Bright has no intention of using his influence to get students Hollywood jobs. "I wouldn't do that," he says. Instead, he's pushing them to find their own way. The process hasn't been easy. The comedy ideas presented so far have surprised Bright at times. "In the beginning there were a lot of domestic social situations where people were yelling at each other. It was weird. I think now they understand that nuance and subtlety can be far funnier than a guy who is screaming at you." The students have also made Bright scratch his head with some of their pop culture observations, like a spoof on Al Gore's environmental documentary An Inconvenient Truth. In one scene, a student says, "That bathroom won't clean itself, mister." "That is an inconvenient truth," Bright quips. "Coming from the '60s, my sensibility of what is great and smart comedy is very different. I like things that have something to say about society. A few times this semester I've had to say 'OK, that's the way it is. This comedy is about people in situations that are familiar to them and people their age. I'm not plugged in.' " Walking around the student set recently, the bespectacled, spiky-haired Bright is tough on his students. On this day, the actors are doing a full-dress rehearsal of a skit about a sober funeral turned festive party. After noticing an unattended camera slowly rolling across the set, Bright snaps, "Hey, lock those wheels please." After waiting in vain for a student to bring him a vacuum cleaner to tidy up the set, Bright grows impatient. "Did we ever find that vacuum?" After a student points to the back of the room, Bright says, "Whenever a director asks for something, bring it to him directly." He asks executive producer Danny Zack, a junior, if Zack is recording the audio on two different tracks. "It can't be done," Zack replies. Bright asks: "Why not? Find the tech person." Although Zack looks overwhelmed, he tells a visitor his career ambition is to direct a multi-camera sitcom, awards show or news program. "I'm trying to stay as calm as possible," he says in a low voice. "It's a little stressful." Bright knows all about stress. This time last year he was under intense pressure to turn around ratings for Joey, the sitcom starring Matt LeBlanc as Joey Tribbiani. In its first season the show averaged 10.2 million viewers but last season numbers were 7.1 million. Bright says NBC executives, the studio and other producers collaborated and quickly ruined the show. "On Friends Joey was a womaniser but we enjoyed his exploits. He was a solid friend, a guy you knew you could count on," Bright says. "Joey was deconstructed to be a guy who couldn't get a job, couldn't ask a girl out. He became a pathetic, mopey character. I felt he was moving in the wrong direction, but I was not heard." Joey finished on US television in March. Although LeBlanc is Bright's best friend (the producer brought him for a campus visit in November), Bright says he was relieved when the 12-year Friends saga ended. "I needed the rest. I worked 60 to 80 hours a week and my life kind of crept by me," says Bright, who turned 52 this month. "I wanted to take time to recharge. I thought about Emerson and a professor, the late Daniel Lounsbery, who single-handedly was responsible for me having great insight into the professional side of television before I left college. He was the greatest mentor and we stayed in touch for years." Given the state of the sitcom, Bright isn't sure what to tell his students about landing a job. "A lot of people go to school for television production," he says. "Very few get far." His Emerson students, he hopes, will be the exception. Best-loved Friends Kevin Bright directed 60 episodes of Friends. These are his favourites. 1. The One With Ross's Wedding, May 7, 1998 "We were the only TV show I know of that shot a show in a foreign country. We did it in a studio with the largest audiences we ever had, three audiences of 500 each. The reception there made me realise that Friends was an international thing." 2. The One Where Monica Gets a Room-mate, September 22, 1994 (aka The One Where It All Began). "Without that and the brilliance of it, the rest wouldn't have followed." 3. The One With the Football, November 21, 1996 "We shot it on two separate stages and moved the audience from one to the other. It was a production challenge." 4. The One in Vegas (Part I), May 20, 1999 "The story lines were great. Joey is working as a Roman guard in Caesar's Palace. This is the one where Chandler and Monica get serious. I enjoyed the scope of it and the production challenge. People thought we went to Vegas." 5. The Last One (Part 2), May 6, 2004 In the series finale, Rachel and Ross decide to stay together. Chandler and Monica pack for the 'burbs. The gang goes out for one last coffee. "It was one of the most emotional weeks of my life. For a change, a series ended in as satisfying a way as when it was running." BOSTON GLOBE Email Print Normal font Large font When you see news happening: SMS/MMS: 0406 THE AGE (0406 843 243), or us.
