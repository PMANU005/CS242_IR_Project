It is the 8th largest state by area, and the 11th largest by population. The state has the third largest population of Scheduled Tribes in India.[14] It neighbours the states of West Bengal and Jharkhand to the north, Chhattisgarh to the west, Andhra Pradesh to the south. Odisha has a coastline of 485 kilometres (301 mi) along the Bay of Bengal.[15] The region is also known as Utkala and is mentioned in India's national anthem, "Jana Gana Mana".[16] The language of Odisha is Odia, which is one of the Classical Languages of India.[17] The ancient kingdom of Kalinga, which was invaded by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka (which was again won back from them by king Kharavela) in 261 BCE resulting in the Kalinga War, coincides with the borders of modern-day Odisha.[18] The modern boundaries of Odisha were demarcated by the British Indian government when Orissa Province was established on 1 April 1936, consisting of the Odia-speaking districts of Bihar and Orissa Province.[18] The first of April is celebrated as Utkala Dibasa.[19] Cuttack was made the capital of the region by Anantavarman Chodaganga in c. 1135,[20] after which the city was used as the capital by many rulers, through the British era until 1948. Thereafter, Bhubaneswar became the capital of Odisha.[21] The economy of Odisha is the 16th-largest state economy in India with ₹5.33 lakh crore (US$71 billion) in gross domestic product and a per capita GDP of ₹116,614 (US$1,500).[3] Odisha ranks 32nd among Indian states in Human Development Index.[22] Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 3 Geography 3.1 Rehabilitation 3.2 Climate 3.3 Biodiversity 4 Government and politics 4.1 Legislative assembly 5 Subdivisions 6 Economy 6.1 Macro-economic trend 6.2 Industrial development 7 Transportation 7.1 Air 7.2 Seaports 7.3 Railways 8 Demographics 8.1 Religion 8.2 Languages 9 Education 9.1 Educational Institutions 10 Culture 10.1 Cuisine 10.2 Dance 11 Sports 12 Tourism 13 See also 14 References 15 External links Etymology See also: History of Odisha § Historical names of Odisha The term "Odisha/Orissa" (Odia: ଓଡ଼ିଶା) is derived from the ancient Prakrit word "Odda Visaya" (also "Udra Bibhasha" or "Odra Bibhasha") as in the Tirumalai inscription of Rajendra Chola I, which is dated to 1025.[23] Sarala Das, who translated the Mahabharata into the Odia language in the 15th century, calls the region 'Odra Rashtra' as Odisha. The inscriptions of Kapilendra Deva of the Gajapati Kingdom (1435–67) on the walls of temples in Puri call the region Odisha or Odisha Rajya.[24] In 2011 the English rendering of ଓଡ଼ିଶା was changed from "Orissa" to "Odisha", and the name of its language from "Oriya" to "Odia", by the passage of the Orissa (Alteration of Name) Bill, 2010 and the Constitution (113th Amendment) Bill, 2010 in the Parliament. The Hindi rendering उड़ीसा (uṛīsa) was also modified to ओड़िशा (oḍisha). After a brief debate, the lower house, Lok Sabha, passed the bill and amendment on 9 November 2010.[25] On 24 March 2011, Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Parliament, also passed the bill and the amendment.[26] The changes in spelling was made so that English and Hindi would conform to Odia transcription.[27] History Main articles: History of Odisha and Historic sites in Odisha Lingaraja Temple built by the Somavanshi king Jajati Keshari Prehistoric Acheulian tools dating to Lower Paleolithic era have been discovered in various places in the region, implying an early settlement by humans.[28] Kalinga has been mentioned in ancient texts like Mahabharata, Vayu Purana and Mahagovinda Suttanta.[29][30] The Sabar people of Odisha have also been mentioned in the Mahabharata.[31][32] Baudhayana mentions Kalinga as not yet being influenced by Vedic traditions, implying it followed mostly tribal traditions.[33] Hathigumpha on the Udayagiri Hills built in c. 150 BCE Shanti Stupa at Dhauli is the location where Kalinga War was fought in c. 260 BCE Ashoka of the Mauryan dynasty conquered Kalinga in the bloody Kalinga War in 261 BCE,[34] which was the eighth year of his reign.[35] According to his own edicts, in that war about 100,000 people were killed, 150,000 were captured and more were affected.[34] The resulting bloodshed and suffering of the war is said to have deeply affected Ashoka. He turned into a pacifist and converted to Buddhism.[35][36] By c. 150 BCE, emperor Kharavela, who was possibly a contemporary of Demetrius I of Bactria,[37] conquered a major part of the Indian sub-continent. Kharavela was a Jain ruler. He also built the monastery atop the Udayagiri hill.[38] Subsequently, the region was ruled by monarchs, such as Samudragupta[39] and Shashanka.[40] It was also a part of Harsha's empire.[41] The city of Brahmapur in Odisha is also known to have been the capital of the Pauravas during the closing years of 4th Century CE. Nothing was heard from the Pauravas from about the 3rd Century CE, because they were annexed by the Yaudheya Republic, who in turn submitted to the Mauryans. It was only at the end of 4th century CE, that they established royalty at Brahmapur, after about 700 years. Later, the kings of the Somavamsi dynasty began to unite the region. By the reign of Yayati II, c. 1025 CE, they had integrated the region into a single kingdom. Yayati II is supposed to have built the Lingaraj temple at Bhubaneswar.[18] They were replaced by the Eastern Ganga dynasty. Notable rulers of the dynasty were Anantavarman Chodaganga, who began re-construction on the present-day Shri Jagannath Temple in Puri (c. 1135), and Narasimhadeva I, who constructed the Konark temple (c. 1250).[42][43] The Eastern Ganga Dynasty was followed by the Gajapati Kingdom. The region resisted integration into the Mughal empire until 1568, when it was conquered by Sultanate of Bengal.[44] Mukunda Deva, who is considered the last independent king of Kalinga, was defeated and was killed in battle by a rebel Ramachandra Bhanja. Ramachandra Bhanja himself was killed by Bayazid Khan Karrani.[45] In 1591, Man Singh I, then governor of Bihar, led an army to take Odisha from the Karranis of Bengal. They agreed to treaty because their leader Qutlu Khan Lohani had recently died. But, they then broke the treaty by attacking the temple town of Puri. Man Singh returned in 1592 and pacified the region.[46] In 1751, the Nawab of Bengal Alivardi Khan ceded the region to the Maratha Empire.[18] The British had occupied the Northern Circars, comprising the southern coast of Odisha, as a result of the Second Carnatic War by 1760, and incorporated them into the Madras Presidency gradually.[47] In 1803, the British ousted the Marathas from the Puri-Cuttack region of Odisha during the Second Anglo-Maratha War. The northern and western districts of Odisha were incorporated into the Bengal Presidency.[48] The Orissa famine of 1866 caused an estimated 1 million deaths.[49] Following this, large-scale irrigation projects were undertaken.[50] In 1903, the Utkal Sammilani organisation was founded to demand the unification of Odia-speaking regions into one state.[51] On 1 April 1912, the Bihar and Orissa Province was formed.[52] On 1 April 1936, Bihar and Orissa were split into separate provinces.[53] The new province of Orissa came into existence on a linguistic basis during the British rule in India, with Sir John Austen Hubback as the first governor.[53][54] Following India's independence, on 15 August 1947, 27 princely states signed the document to join Orissa.[55] Most of the Orissa Tributary States, a group of princely states, acceded to Orissa in 1948, after the collapse of the Eastern States Union.[56] Geography Main article: Geography of Odisha Mahanadi river near Cuttack Odisha lies between the latitudes 17.780N and 22.730N, and between longitudes 81.37E and 87.53E. The state has an area of 155,707 km2, which is 4.87% of total area of India, and a coastline of 450 km.[57] In the eastern part of the state lies the coastal plain. It extends from the Subarnarekha River in the north to the Rushikulya river in the south. The lake Chilika is part of the coastal plains. The plains are rich in fertile silt deposited by the six major rivers flowing into the Bay of Bengal: Subarnarekha, Budhabalanga, Baitarani, Brahmani, Mahanadi and Rushikulya.[57] The Central Rice Research Institute (CRRI), a Food and Agriculture Organization-recognised rice gene bank and research institute, is situated on the banks of Mahanadi in Cuttack.[58] The stretch between Puri and Bhadrak in Odisha juts out a little into the sea, making it vulnerable to any cyclonic activity.[59] Satellite view of the Mahanadi river delta Three-quarters of the state is covered in mountain ranges. Deep and broad valleys have been made in them by rivers. These valleys have fertile soil and are densely populated. Odisha also has plateaus and rolling uplands, which have lower elevation than the plateaus.[57] The highest point in the state is Deomali at 1,672 metres in Koraput district. Some other high peaks are: Sinkaram (1,620 m), Golikoda (1,617 m), and Yendrika (1,582 metres).[60] Rehabilitation 876 families of East Pakistan displaced persons have been rehabilitated in Orissa up to 31 October 1958 [61] Climate The state experiences four meteorological seasons: winter (January to February), pre-monsoon season (March to May), south-west monsoon season (June to September) and north east monsoon season (October–December). However, locally the year is divided into six traditional seasons (or rutus): Grishma (summer), Barsha (rainy season), Sharata (autumn), Hemanta (dewy),Sheeta(winter season) and Basanta (spring).[57] Mean Temp and Precipitation of Selected Weather Stations[62] Bhubaneswar (1952–2000) Balasore (1901–2000) Gopalpur (1901–2000) Sambalpur (1901–2000) Max (C) Min (C) Rainfall (mm) Max (C) Min (C) Rainfall (mm) Max (C) Min (C) Rainfall (mm) Max (C) Min (C) Rainfall (mm) January 28.5 15.5 13.1 27.0 13.9 17.0 27.2 16.9 11.0 27.6 12.6 14.2 February 31.6 18.6 25.5 29.5 16.7 36.3 28.9 19.5 23.6 30.1 15.1 28.0 March 35.1 22.3 25.2 33.7 21.0 39.4 30.7 22.6 18.1 35.0 19.0 20.9 April 37.2 25.1 30.8 36.0 24.4 54.8 31.2 25.0 20.3 39.3 23.5 14.2 May 37.5 26.5 68.2 36.1 26.0 108.6 32.4 26.7 53.8 41.4 27.0 22.7 June 35.2 26.1 204.9 34.2 26.2 233.4 32.3 26.8 138.1 36.9 26.7 218.9 July 32.0 25.2 326.2 31.8 25.8 297.9 31.0 26.1 174.6 31.1 24.9 459.0 August 31.6 25.1 366.8 31.4 25.8 318.3 31.2 25.9 195.9 30.7 24.8 487.5 September 31.9 24.8 256.3 31.7 25.5 275.8 31.7 25.7 192.0 31.7 24.6 243.5 October 31.7 23.0 190.7 31.3 23.0 184.0 31.4 23.8 237.8 31.7 21.8 56.6 November 30.2 18.8 41.7 29.2 17.8 41.6 29.5 19.7 95.3 29.4 16.2 17.6 December 28.3 15.2 4.9 26.9 13.7 6.5 27.4 16.4 11.4 27.2 12.1 4.8 Biodiversity Main articles: Flora and fauna of Odisha and Forests in Odisha According to a Forest Survey of India report released in 2012, Odisha has 48,903 km2 of forests which cover 31.41% of the state's total area. The forests are classified into: dense forest (7,060 km2), medium dense forest (21,366 km2), open forest (forest without closed canopy; 20,477 km2) and scrub forest (4,734 km2). The state also has bamboo forests (10,518 km2) and mangroves (221 km2). The state is losing its forests to timber smuggling, mining, industrialisation and grazing. There have been attempts at conservation and reforestation.[63] Due to the climate and good rainfall, Odisha's evergreen and moist forests are suitable habitats for wild orchids. Around 130 species have been reported from the state.[64] 97 of them are found in Mayurbhanj district alone. The Orchid House of Nandakanan Biological Park hosts some of these species.[65] Simlipal National Park is a protected wildlife area and tiger reserve spread over 2,750 km2 of the northern part of Mayurbhanj district. It has 1078 species of plants, including 94 orchids. The sal tree is the primary tree species there. The park has 55 mammals, including barking deer, Bengal tiger, common langur, four-horned antelope, Indian bison, Indian elephant, Indian giant squirrel, Indian leopard, jungle cat, sambar deer, and wild boar. There are 304 species of birds in the park, such as the common hill myna, grey hornbill, Indian pied hornbill and Malabar pied hornbill. It also has 60 species of reptiles, notable among which are the king cobra, banded krait, and tricarinate hill turtle. There is also a mugger crocodile breeding program in nearby Ramtirtha.[66] The Chandaka Elephant Sanctuary is a 190 km2 protected area near the capital city, Bhubaneswar. However, urban expansion and over-grazing have reduced the forests and are driving herds of elephants to migration. In 2002, there were about 80 elephants. But by 2012, their numbers had been reduced to 20. Many of the animals have migrated toward the Barbara reserve forest, Chilika, Nayagarh district, and Athagad. Some elephants have died in conflicts with villagers, while some have died during migration from being electrocuted by power lines or hit by trains. Outside the protected area, they are killed by poachers.[67][68] Besides elephants, the sanctuary also has Indian leopards, jungle cats and chitals.[69] The Bhitarkanika National Park in Kendrapara district covers 650 km2, of which 150 km2 are mangroves. The Gahirmatha Beach in Bhitarkanika is the world's largest nesting site for olive ridley sea turtles.[70] Other major nesting grounds for the turtle in the state are Rushikulya, in Ganjam district,[71] and the mouth of the Devi river.[72] The Bhitarkanika sanctuary is also noted for its large population of salt-water crocodiles.[73] In winter, the sanctuary is also visited by migratory birds. Among the species of birds spotted in the sanctuary are the black-crowned night heron, darter, grey heron, Indian cormorant, Oriental white ibis, purple heron, and sarus crane.[74] The possibly endangered horseshoe crab is also found in this region.[75] Chilika Lake is a brackish water lagoon on the east coast of Odisha with an area of 1,105 km2. It is connected to the Bay of Bengal by a 35-km-long narrow channel and is a part of the Mahanadi delta. In the dry season, the tides bring in salt water. In the rainy season, the rivers falling into the lagoon decrease its salinity.[76] Birds from places like the Caspian Sea, Lake Baikal, other parts of Russia, Central Asia, South-East Asia, Ladakh and the Himalayas migrate to the lagoon in winter.[77] Among the birds spotted there are Eurasian wigeon, pintail, bar-headed goose, greylag goose, flamingo, mallard and Goliath heron.[78][79] The lagoon also has a small population of the endangered Irrawaddy dolphins.[80] The state's coastal region has also had sightings of finless porpoise, bottlenose dolphin, humpback dolphin and spinner dolphin in its waters.[81] Satapada is situated close to the northeast cape of Chilika Lake and Bay of Bengal. It is famous for dolphin watching in their natural habitat. There is a tiny island en route for watching dolphins, where tourists often take a short stop. Apart from that, this island is also home for tiny red crabs. According to a census conducted in 2016, there are around 2000 elephants in the state. [82] White tiger in the Nandankanan Zoo Irrawaddy dolphins can be found in Chilika Vanda tessellata, one of the orchids found in Odisha[83] Birds at Chilika Lake Crocodile in Bhitarkanika National Park Government and politics Odisha State Secretariat building in Bhubaneswar Main article: Government of Odisha All states in India are governed by a parliamentary system of government based on universal adult franchise.[84][85] The main parties active in the politics of Odisha are the Biju Janata Dal, the Indian National Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party. Following the Odisha State Assembly Election in 2019, the Naveen Patnaik-led Biju Janata Dal stayed in power for the sixth consecutive term, he is the 14th chief minister of odisha since 2000.[86] Legislative assembly Main articles: Odisha Legislative Assembly and Vidhan Sabha The Odisha state has a unicameral legislature.[87] The Odisha Legislative Assembly consists of 147 elected members,[86] and special office bearers such as the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, who are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker, or by the Deputy Speaker in the Speaker's absence.[88] Executive authority is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister, although the titular head of government is the Governor of Odisha. The governor is appointed by the President of India. The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister by the governor, and the Council of Ministers are appointed by the governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly.[89] The 147 elected representatives are called Members of the Legislative Assembly, or MLAs. One MLA may be nominated from the Anglo-Indian community by the governor.[90] The term of the office is for five years, unless the Assembly is dissolved prior to the completion of the term.[88] The judiciary is composed of the Odisha High Court, located at Cuttack, and a system of lower courts. Subdivisions Main article: List of districts of Odisha Odisha has been divided into 30 districts. These 30 districts have been placed under three different revenue divisions to streamline their governance. The divisions are North, Central and South, with their headquarters at Sambalpur, Cuttack and Berhampur respectively. Each division consists of ten districts and has as its administrative head a Revenue Divisional Commissioner (RDC).[91] The position of the RDC in the administrative hierarchy is that between that of the district administration and the state secretariat.[92] The RDCs report to the Board of Revenue, which is headed by a senior officer of the Indian Administrative Service.[91] Map of districts of Odisha Division-wise list of districts[93] Northern Division (HQ – Sambalpur) Central Division (HQ – Cuttack) Southern Division (HQ – Berhampur) Angul Balangir Bargarh Deogarh Dhenkanal Jharsuguda Kendujhar Sambalpur Subarnapur Sundargarh Balasore Bhadrak Cuttack Jagatsinghpur Jajpur Kendrapada Khordha Mayurbhanj Nayagarh Puri Boudh Gajapati Ganjam Kalahandi Kandhamal Koraput Malkangiri Nabarangpur Nuapada Rayagada Each district is governed by a collector and district magistrate, who is appointed from the Indian Administrative Service or a very senior officer from Odisha Administrative Service.[94][95] The collector and district magistrate is responsible for collecting the revenue and maintaining law and order in the district. Each district is separated into sub-divisions, each governed by a sub-collector and sub-divisional magistrate. The sub-divisions are further divided into tahasils. The tahasils are headed by tahasildar. Odisha has 58 sub-divisions, 317 tahasils and 314 blocks.[93] Blocks consists of Panchayats (village councils) and town municipalities. The capital and largest city of the state is Bhubaneswar. The other major cities are Cuttack, Rourkela, Berhampur and Sambalpur.

Economy Main article: Economy of Odisha Macro-economic trend Odisha is experiencing steady economic growth. The impressive growth in gross domestic product of the state has been reported by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. Odisha's growth rate is above the national average.[96] The central Government's Urban Development Ministry has recently announced the names of 20 cities selected to be developed as smart cities. The state capital Bhubaneswar is the first city in the list of smart Cities released in January 2016, a pet project of the Indian Government. The announcement also marked with sanction of Rs 508.02 billion over the five years for development.[97] Industrial development One of the iron ore mines in Keonjhar district Rourkela Steel Plant Odisha has abundant natural resources and a large coastline. Odisha has emerged as the most preferred destination for overseas investors with investment proposals.[98] It contains a fifth of India's coal, a quarter of its iron ore, a third of its bauxite reserves and most of the chromite. Rourkela Steel Plant[99] was the first integrated steel plant in the public sector in India, built with collaboration of Germany. Arcelor-Mittal has also announced plans to invest in another mega steel project amounting to $10 billion. Russian major Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Company (MMK) plans to set up a 10 MT steel plant in Odisha, too. Bandhabahal is a major area of open cast coal mines in Odisha. The state is attracting an unprecedented amount of investment in aluminium, coal-based power plants, petrochemicals, and information technology as well. In power generation, Reliance Power (Anil Ambani Group) is putting up the world's largest power plant with an investment of US$13 billion at Hirma in Jharsuguda district.[100] In 2009 Odisha was the second top domestic investment destination with Gujarat first and Andhra Pradesh in third place according to an analysis of ASSOCHAM Investment Meter (AIM) study on corporate investments. Odisha's share was 12.6 percent in total investment in the country. It received investment proposal worth ₹. 2,00,846 crore during the last year. Steel and power were among the sectors which attracted maximum investments in the state.[101] Transportation Odisha has a network of roads, railways, airports and seaports. Bhubaneswar is well connected by air, rail and road with the rest of India. Some highways are getting expanded to four lanes.[102] Plans for metro rail connecting Bhubaneshwar and Cuttack, a journey of 30 km, have also started.[103] Air Biju Patnaik Airport, Bhubaneswar Odisha has a total of two operational airports, 17 airstrips and 16 helipads.[104][105][106] The airport at Jharsuguda was upgraded to a full-fledged domestic airport in May 2018.[107] The government of Odisha also plans five greenfield airports at Angul, Dhamra, Kalinganagar, Paradeep and Rayagada in an effort to boost intrastate and inter-state civil aviation. Existing aerodromes at Barbil, Gopalpur, Jharsuguda and Rourkela were also to be upgraded.[108] The Dhamra Port Company Limited plans to build Dhamra Airport 20 km from Dhamra Port.[109] Air Odisha, is Odisha's sole air charter company based in Bhubaneswar.[citation needed] Angul – Savitri Jindal Airport Bargarh – Sativata Airstrip Bhawanipatna – Utkela Airstrip (being prepared under UDAN scheme) Bhubaneswar – Biju Patnaik Airport (functioning regularly) Brahmapur – Berhampur Airport Cuttack – Charbatia Air Base Jeypore – Jeypore Airport (being prepared under UDAN scheme) Jharsuguda – Veer Surendra Sai Airport (functioning under UDAN scheme) Rourkela – Rourkela Airport (being prepared under UDAN scheme) Sambalpur – Hirakud Airstrip Seaports Gopalpur Port East Coast Railway headquarters, Bhubaneswar Odisha has a coastline of 485 Kilometers.

Some of the major dialects found inside the state are Sambalpuri, Cuttacki, Puri, Baleswari, Ganjami, Desiya and Phulbani. In addition to Odia, significant population of people speaking other major Indian languages like Hindi, Telugu, Urdu and Bengali are also found in the state.[123] The different adibasi communities who mostly reside in Western Odisha have their own languages belonging to Austroasiatic and Dravidian family of languages. Some of these major adibasi languages are Santali, Kui and Ho. Due to increasing contact with outsiders, migration and socioeconomic reasons many of these indigenous languages are slowly getting extinct or are on the verge of getting extinct.[124] The Odisha Sahitya Academy Award was established in 1957 to actively develop Odia language and literature. The Odisha government launched a portal https://ova.gov.in/en in 2018 to promote Odia language and literature.
