On March 2, 2011, ETC moved to RPN after the channel is private, while Talk TV, a news-oriented channel airing local and US news shows, launched on SBN 21.[2][3][4][5][6][7] But, ETC returned to SBN on November 30, 2013, as Solar News Channel moved to RPN on December 1 of 2013 to allow SNC's wider coverage.
