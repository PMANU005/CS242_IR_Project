Kolkata (English: /kɒlˈkɑːtə/[15] or /kɒlˈkʌtə/,[16] Bengali: [kolˈkata] (listen); also known as Calcutta /kælˈkʌtə/,[16] the official name until 2001) is the capital of the Indian state of West Bengal. Located on the eastern bank of the Hooghly River, the city is approximately 80 kilometres (50 mi) west of the border with Bangladesh. It is the primary business, commercial, and financial hub of Eastern India and the main port of communication for North-East India.[17] According to the 2011 Indian census, Kolkata is the seventh-most populous city in India, with a population of 45 lakh (4.5 million) residents within the city limits, and a population of over 1.41 crore (14.1 million) residents in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area. It is the third-most populous metropolitan area in India. In 2021, Kolkata metropolitan area crossed 1.5 crore (15 million) registered voters. The Port of Kolkata is India's oldest operating port and its sole major riverine port. Kolkata is regarded as the Cultural Capital of India.[1][18] In the late 17th century, the three villages that predated Calcutta were ruled by the Nawab of Bengal under Mughal suzerainty. After the Nawab granted the East India Company a trading licence in 1690,[19] the area was developed by the Company into an increasingly fortified trading post known as Fort William. Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah occupied Calcutta in 1756, and the East India Company retook it the following year. In 1793 the East India company was strong enough to abolish native rule, and assumed full sovereignty of the region. Under the company rule and later under the British Raj, Calcutta served as the capital of British-held territories in India until 1911. At that time, the British assessed its perceived geographical disadvantages, combined with growing nationalism in Bengal, and moved the capital to New Delhi. Calcutta was the centre for the Indian independence movement. Following independence in 1947, Kolkata, which was once the centre of Indian commerce, culture, and politics, suffered many decades of political violence and economic stagnation.[20] A demographically diverse city, the culture of Kolkata features idiosyncrasies that include distinctively close-knit neighbourhoods (paras) and freestyle conversations (adda). Kolkata is home to West Bengal's film industry Tollywood and cultural institutions, such as the Academy of Fine Arts, the Victoria Memorial, the Asiatic Society, the Indian Museum, and the National Library of India. Among scientific institutions, Kolkata hosts the Agri Horticultural Society of India, the Geological Survey of India, the Botanical Survey of India, the Calcutta Mathematical Society, the Indian Science Congress Association, the Zoological Survey of India, the Institution of Engineers, the Anthropological Survey of India and the Indian Public Health Association. Four Nobel laureates and two Nobel Memorial Prize winners are associated with the city.[21] Though home to major cricketing venues and franchises, Kolkata differs from other Indian cities by focusing on association football and other sports.

Similarly, it can be a variation of 'Kalikshetra' (Sanskrit: कालीक्षेत्र, lit. "area of Goddess Kali"). Another theory is that the name derives from Kalighat.[23] Alternatively, the name may have been derived from the Bengali term kilkila (Bengali: কিলকিলা), or "flat area".[24] The name may have its origin in the words khal (Bengali: খাল [ˈkʰal]) meaning "canal", followed by kaṭa (Bengali: কাটা [ˈkaʈa]), which may mean "dug".[25] According to another theory, the area specialised in the production of quicklime or koli chun (Bengali: কলি চুন [ˈkɔliˌtʃun]) and coir or kata (Bengali: কাতা [ˈkata]); hence, it was called Kolikata).[24] Although the city's name has always been pronounced Kolkata or Kôlikata in Bengali, the anglicised form Calcutta was the official name until 2001, when it was changed to Kolkata in order to match Bengali pronunciation.[26] History Main article: History of Kolkata Fort William, headquarters of the British East India Company British colonial rule Arms of the city of Calcutta, c. 1914. The discovery and archaeological study of Chandraketugarh, 35 kilometres (22 mi) north of Kolkata, provide evidence that the region in which the city stands has been inhabited for over two millennia.[27][28] Kolkata's recorded history began in 1690 with the arrival of the English East India Company, which was consolidating its trade business in Bengal. Job Charnock, an administrator who worked for the company, was formerly credited as the founder of the city;[29] In response to a public petition,[30] the Calcutta High Court ruled in 2003 that the city does not have a founder.[31] The area occupied by the present-day city encompassed three villages: Kalikata, Gobindapur and Sutanuti. Kalikata was a fishing village; Sutanuti was a riverside weavers' village. They were part of an estate belonging to the Mughal emperor; the jagirdari (a land grant bestowed by a king on his noblemen) taxation rights to the villages were held by the Sabarna Roy Choudhury family of landowners, or zamindars. These rights were transferred to the East India Company in 1698.[32]: 1  Chowringhee avenue and Tipu Sultan Mosque in central Calcutta, 1945. In 1712, the British completed the construction of Fort William, located on the east bank of the Hooghly River to protect their trading factory.[33] Facing frequent skirmishes with French forces, the British began to upgrade their fortifications in 1756. The Nawab of Bengal, Siraj ud-Daulah, condemned the militarisation and tax evasion by the company. His warning went unheeded, and the Nawab attacked; he captured Fort William which led to the killings of several East India company officials in the Black Hole of Calcutta.[34] A force of Company soldiers (sepoys) and British troops led by Robert Clive recaptured the city the following year.[34] Per the 1765 Treaty of Allahabad following the battle of Buxar, East India company was appointed imperial tax collector of the Mughal emperor in the province of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, while Mughal-appointed Nawabs continued to rule the province.[35] Declared a presidency city, Calcutta became the headquarters of the East India Company by 1773.[36] In 1793, ruling power of the Nawabs were abolished and East India company took complete control of the city and the province. In the early 19th century, the marshes surrounding the city were drained; the government area was laid out along the banks of the Hooghly River. Richard Wellesley, Governor-General of the Presidency of Fort William between 1797 and 1805, was largely responsible for the development of the city and its public architecture.[37] Throughout the late 18th and 19th century, the city was a centre of the East India Company's opium trade.[38] A census in 1837 records the population of the city proper as 229,700, of which the British residents made up only 3,138.[39] The same source says another 177,000 resided in the suburbs and neighbouring villages, making the entire population of greater Calcutta 406,700. In 1864, a typhoon struck the city and killed about 60,000 in Kolkata.[40] Panoramic view of Kolkata (Calcutta) from the Shaheed Minar (Octerlony Monument), 1832, drawn by Jacob Janssen By the 1850s, Calcutta had two areas: White Town, which was primarily British and centred on Chowringhee and Dalhousie Square; and Black Town, mainly Indian and centred on North Calcutta.[41] The city underwent rapid industrial growth starting in the early 1850s, especially in the textile and jute industries; this encouraged British companies to massively invest in infrastructure projects, which included telegraph connections and Howrah railway station. The coalescence of British and Indian culture resulted in the emergence of a new babu class of urbane Indians, whose members were often bureaucrats, professionals, newspaper readers, and Anglophiles; they usually belonged to upper-caste Hindu communities.[42] In the 19th century, the Bengal Renaissance brought about an increased sociocultural sophistication among city denizens. In 1883, Calcutta was host to the first national conference of the Indian National Association, the first avowed nationalist organisation in India.[43] Bengali billboards on Harrison Street. Calcutta was the largest commercial centre in British India. The partition of Bengal in 1905 along religious lines led to mass protests, making Calcutta a less hospitable place for the British.[44][45] The capital was moved to New Delhi in 1911.[46] Calcutta continued to be a centre for revolutionary organisations associated with the Indian independence movement. The city and its port were bombed several times by the Japanese between 1942 and 1944, during World War II.[47][48] Coinciding with the war, millions starved to death during the Bengal famine of 1943 due to a combination of military, administrative, and natural factors.[49] Demands for the creation of a Muslim state led in 1946 to an episode of communal violence that killed over 4,000.[50][51][52] The partition of India led to further clashes and a demographic shift—many Muslims left for East Pakistan (present day Bangladesh), while hundreds of thousands of Hindus fled into the city.[53] Contemporary During the 1960s and 1970s, severe power shortages, strikes and a violent Marxist–Maoist movement by groups known as the Naxalites damaged much of the city's infrastructure, resulting in economic stagnation.[20] The Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 led to a massive influx of thousands of refugees, many of them penniless, that strained Kolkata's infrastructure.[54] During the mid-1980s, Mumbai (then called Bombay) overtook Kolkata as India's most populous city. In 1985, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi dubbed Kolkata a "dying city" in light of its socio-political woes.[55] In the period 1977–2011, West Bengal was governed from Kolkata by the Left Front, which was dominated by the Communist Party of India (CPM). It was the world's longest-serving democratically elected communist government, during which Kolkata was a key base for Indian communism.[56][57][58] In the 2011 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election, Left Front was defeated by the Trinamool Congress. The city's economic recovery gathered momentum after the 1990s, when India began to institute pro-market reforms. Since 2000, the information technology (IT) services sector has revitalised Kolkata's stagnant economy. The city is also experiencing marked growth in its manufacturing base.[59] Geography Main article: Geography of Kolkata Chowringhee, Kolkata skyline from Howrah Spread roughly north–south along the east bank of the Hooghly River, Kolkata sits within the lower Ganges Delta of eastern India approximately 75 km (47 mi) west of the international border with Bangladesh; the city's elevation is 1.5–9 m (5–30 ft).[60] Much of the city was originally a wetland that was reclaimed over the decades to accommodate a burgeoning population.[61] The remaining undeveloped areas, known as the East Kolkata Wetlands, were designated a "wetland of international importance" by the Ramsar Convention (1975).[62] As with most of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, the soil and water are predominantly alluvial in origin. Kolkata is located over the "Bengal basin", a pericratonic tertiary basin.[63] Bengal basin comprises three structural units: shelf or platform in the west; central hinge or shelf/slope break; and deep basinal part in the east and southeast. Kolkata is located atop the western part of the hinge zone which is about 25 km (16 mi) wide at a depth of about 45,000 m (148,000 ft) below the surface.[63] The shelf and hinge zones have many faults, among them some are active. Total thickness of sediment below Kolkata is nearly 7,500 m (24,600 ft) above the crystalline basement; of these the top 350–450 m (1,150–1,480 ft) is Quaternary, followed by 4,500–5,500 m (14,760–18,040 ft) of Tertiary sediments, 500–700 m (1,640–2,300 ft) trap wash of Cretaceous trap and 600–800 m (1,970–2,620 ft) Permian-Carboniferous Gondwana rocks.[63] The quaternary sediments consist of clay, silt and several grades of sand and gravel. These sediments are sandwiched between two clay beds: the lower one at a depth of 250–650 m (820–2,130 ft); the upper one 10–40 m (30–130 ft) in thickness.[64] According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, on a scale ranging from I to V in order of increasing susceptibility to earthquakes, the city lies inside seismic zone III.[65] Urban structure Map of Calcutta, ca 1914 Aerial view of the Kolkata skyline, including the Victoria Memorial and Vidyasagar Setu The Kolkata metropolitan area is spread over 1,886.67 km2 (728.45 sq mi)[66]: 7  and comprises 4 municipal corporations (including Kolkata Municipal Corporation), 37 local municipalities and 24 panchayat samitis, as of 2011.[66]: 7  The urban agglomeration encompassed 72 cities and 527 towns and villages, as of 2006.[67] Suburban areas in the Kolkata metropolitan area incorporate parts of the following districts: North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly and Nadia.[68]: 15  Kolkata, which is under the jurisdiction of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC), has an area of 206.08 km2 (80 sq mi).[67] The east–west dimension of the city is comparatively narrow, stretching from the Hooghly River in the west to roughly the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass in the east—a span of 9–10 km (5.6–6.2 mi).[69] The north–south distance is greater, and its axis is used to section the city into North, Central, South and East Kolkata. North Kolkata is the oldest part of the city. Characterised by 19th-century architecture and narrow alleyways, it includes areas such as Jorasanko, Rajabazar, Maniktala, Ultadanga, Shyambazar, Shobhabazar, Bagbazar, Cossipore, Sinthee etc. The north suburban areas like Dum Dum, Baranagar, Belgharia, Sodepur, Khardaha, New Barrackpore, Madhyamgram, Barrackpore, Barasat etc. are also within the city of Kolkata (as a metropolitan structure).[68]: 65–66  Central Kolkata hosts the central business district. It contains B.B.D. Bagh, formerly known as Dalhousie Square, and the Esplanade on its east; Strand Road is on its west.[70] The West Bengal Secretariat, General Post Office, Reserve Bank of India, Calcutta High Court, Lalbazar Police Headquarters and several other government and private offices are located there. Another business hub is the area south of Park Street, which comprises thoroughfares such as Chowringhee Road, Camac Street, Wood Street, Loudon Street, Shakespeare Sarani and AJC Bose Road.[71] South Kolkata developed after India gained independence in 1947; it includes upscale neighbourhoods such as Bhawanipore, Alipore, Ballygunge, Kasba, Dhakuria, Santoshpur, Garia, Golf Green, Tollygunge, New Alipore, Behala, Barisha etc. The south suburban areas like Maheshtala, Budge Budge, Rajpur Sonarpur, Baruipur etc. are also within the city of Kolkata (as a metropolitan structure).[22] The Maidan is a large open field in the heart of the city that has been called the "lungs of Kolkata"[72] and accommodates sporting events and public meetings.[73] The Victoria Memorial and Kolkata Race Course are located at the southern end of the Maidan. Among the other parks are Central Park in Bidhannagar and Millennium Park on Strand Road, along the Hooghly River. Two planned townships in the greater Kolkata region are Bidhannagar, also known as Salt Lake City and located north-east of the city; and Rajarhat, also called New Town and located east of Bidhannagar.[22][74] In the 2000s, Sector V in Bidhannagar developed into a business hub for information technology and telecommunication companies.[75][76] Both Bidhannagar and New Town are situated outside the Kolkata Municipal Corporation limits, in their own municipalities.[74] Climate Main article: Climate of Kolkata Kolkata is subject to a tropical wet-and-dry climate that is designated Aw under the Köppen climate classification. According to a United Nations Development Programme report, its wind and cyclone zone is "very high damage risk".[65] Temperature The annual mean temperature is 26.8 °C (80.2 °F); monthly mean temperatures are 19–30 °C (66–86 °F). Summers (March–June) are hot and humid, with temperatures in the low 30s Celsius; during dry spells, maximum temperatures sometime exceed 40 °C (104 °F) in May and June.[77] Winter lasts for roughly two-and-a-half months, with seasonal lows dipping to 9–11 °C (48–52 °F) in December and January. May is the hottest month, with daily temperatures ranging from 27–37 °C (81–99 °F); January, the coldest month, has temperatures varying from 12–23 °C (54–73 °F). The highest recorded temperature is 43.9 °C (111.0 °F), and the lowest is 5 °C (41 °F).[77] The winter is mild and very comfortable weather pertains over the city throughout this season. Often, in April–June, the city is struck by heavy rains or dusty squalls that are followed by thunderstorms or hailstorms, bringing cooling relief from the prevailing humidity. These thunderstorms are convective in nature, and are known locally as kal bôishakhi (কালবৈশাখী), or "Nor'westers" in English.[78] Rainfall Rains brought by the Bay of Bengal branch of the south-west summer monsoon[79] lash Kolkata between June and September, supplying it with most of its annual rainfall of about 1,850 mm (73 in). The highest monthly rainfall total occurs in July and August. In these months often incessant rain for days brings life to a stall for the city dwellers. The city receives 2,107 hours of sunshine per year, with maximum sunlight exposure occurring in April.[80] Kolkata has been hit by several cyclones; these include systems occurring in 1737 and 1864 that killed thousands.[81][82] More recently, Cyclone Aila in 2009 and Cyclone Amphan in 2020 caused widespread damage to Kolkata by bringing catastrophic winds and torrential rainfall. v t e Climate data for Kolkata (Alipore) 1981–2010, extremes 1901–2012 Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 32.8 (91.0) 38.4 (101.1) 41.1 (106.0) 43.3 (109.9) 43.7 (110.7) 43.9 (111.0) 39.9 (103.8) 38.4 (101.1) 38.9 (102.0) 39.0 (102.2) 34.9 (94.8) 32.5 (90.5) 43.9 (111.0) Mean maximum °C (°F) 29.8 (85.6) 33.5 (92.3) 37.4 (99.3) 38.5 (101.3) 38.8 (101.8) 38.0 (100.4) 35.9 (96.6) 35.0 (95.0) 35.3 (95.5) 35.1 (95.2) 32.9 (91.2) 29.8 (85.6) 39.8 (103.6) Average high °C (°F) 25.8 (78.4) 29.2 (84.6) 33.5 (92.3) 35.3 (95.5) 35.3 (95.5) 33.8 (92.8) 32.4 (90.3) 32.2 (90.0) 32.4 (90.3) 32.2 (90.0) 30.1 (86.2) 27.0 (80.6) 31.6 (88.9) Daily mean °C (°F) 20.0 (68.0) 23.6 (74.5) 28.0 (82.4) 30.4 (86.7) 30.9 (87.6) 30.4 (86.7) 29.4 (84.9) 29.3 (84.7) 29.2 (84.6) 28.1 (82.6) 25.0 (77.0) 21.2 (70.2) 27.1 (80.8) Average low °C (°F) 14.1 (57.4) 17.8 (64.0) 22.4 (72.3) 25.3 (77.5) 26.4 (79.5) 26.8 (80.2) 26.5 (79.7) 26.4 (79.5) 26.0 (78.8) 24.1 (75.4) 19.7 (67.5) 15.2 (59.4) 22.6 (72.7) Mean minimum °C (°F) 10.7 (51.3) 12.9 (55.2) 17.6 (63.7) 20.4 (68.7) 21.5 (70.7) 23.7 (74.7) 24.3 (75.7) 24.4 (75.9) 23.8 (74.8) 20.6 (69.1) 15.4 (59.7) 11.8 (53.2) 10.4 (50.7) Record low °C (°F) 6.7 (44.1) 7.2 (45.0) 10.0 (50.0) 16.1 (61.0) 17.9 (64.2) 20.4 (68.7) 20.6 (69.1) 22.6 (72.7) 20.6 (69.1) 17.2 (63.0) 10.6 (51.1) 7.2 (45.0) 6.7 (44.1) Average rainfall mm (inches) 10.4 (0.41) 20.9 (0.82) 35.2 (1.39) 58.9 (2.32) 133.1 (5.24) 300.6 (11.83) 396.0 (15.59) 344.5 (13.56) 318.1 (12.52) 180.5 (7.11) 35.1 (1.38) 3.2 (0.13) 1,836.5 (72.30) Average rainy days 1.1 1.7 2.2 3.4 7.0 12.8 17.7 16.9 13.9 7.4 1.3 0.5 85.9 Average relative humidity (%) (at 17:30 IST) 61 54 51 62 68 77 82 83 82 75 67 65 69 Mean monthly sunshine hours 213.9 211.9 229.4 240.0 232.5 135.0 105.4 117.8 126.0 201.5 216.0 204.6 2,234 Mean daily sunshine hours 6.9 7.5 7.4 8.0 7.5 4.5 3.4 3.8 4.2 6.5 7.2 6.6 6.1 Average ultraviolet index 6 7 10 11 12 13 13 13 12 9 7 5 10 Source 1: India Meteorological Department (sun 1971–2000)[83][84][85]Ultraviolet Index [86] Source 2: Tokyo Climate Center (mean temperatures 1981–2010)[87] Climate data for Kolkata (Dumdum Airport) 1981–2007, extremes 1939–2012 Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 32.5 (90.5) 37.3 (99.1) 40.6 (105.1) 42.8 (109.0) 43.1 (109.6) 43.7 (110.7) 39.2 (102.6) 37.7 (99.9) 36.8 (98.2) 36.8 (98.2) 36.0 (96.8) 33.0 (91.4) 43.7 (110.7) Average high °C (°F) 25.6 (78.1) 29.0 (84.2) 33.3 (91.9) 35.5 (95.9) 35.6 (96.1) 34.3 (93.7) 32.9 (91.2) 32.7 (90.9) 32.8 (91.0) 32.2 (90.0) 29.9 (85.8) 26.8 (80.2) 31.7 (89.1) Average low °C (°F) 12.9 (55.2) 16.6 (61.9) 21.3 (70.3) 24.7 (76.5) 25.9 (78.6) 26.5 (79.7) 26.3 (79.3) 26.4 (79.5) 25.9 (78.6) 23.8 (74.8) 19.0 (66.2) 14.0 (57.2) 21.9 (71.4) Record low °C (°F) 5.0 (41.0) 6.1 (43.0) 12.1 (53.8) 16.6 (61.9) 17.6 (63.7) 19.2 (66.6) 20.1 (68.2) 21.1 (70.0) 21.7 (71.1) 15.7 (60.3) 11.7 (53.1) 6.1 (43.0) 5.0 (41.0) Average rainfall mm (inches) 12.4 (0.49) 23.3 (0.92) 31.3 (1.23) 55.2 (2.17) 156.5 (6.16) 293.0 (11.54) 347.4 (13.68) 344.1 (13.55) 305.5 (12.03) 161.9 (6.37) 17.5 (0.69) 8.8 (0.35) 1,757 (69.17) Average rainy days 1.0 1.7 2.2 3.5 7.0 12.6 17.1 16.9 13.2 6.8 1.3 0.5 83.9 Average relative humidity (%) (at 08:30 IST) 75 71 67 71 73 79 83 83 81 75 70 72 75 Source: India Meteorological Department[88][89] Environmental issues Main article: Environmental issues in Kolkata Pollution is a major concern in Kolkata. As of 2008[update], sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide annual concentration were within the national ambient air quality standards of India, but respirable suspended particulate matter levels were high, and on an increasing trend for five consecutive years, causing smog and haze.[90][91] Severe air pollution in the city has caused a rise in pollution-related respiratory ailments, such as lung cancer.[92] Economy Main article: Economy of Kolkata Reserve Bank of India building, Kolkata Kolkata is the commercial and financial hub of East and North-East India[68] and home to the Calcutta Stock Exchange.[93][94] It is a major commercial and military port, and is the only city in eastern India, apart from Bhubaneswar to have an international airport. Once India's leading city, Kolkata experienced a steady economic decline in the decades following India's independence due to steep population increases and a rise in militant trade-unionism, which included frequent strikes that were backed by left-wing parties.[59] From the 1960s to the late 1990s, several factories were closed and businesses relocated.[59] The lack of capital and resources added to the depressed state of the city's economy and gave rise to an unwelcome sobriquet: the "dying city".[95] The city's fortunes improved after the Indian economy was liberalised in the 1990s and changes in economic policy were enacted by the West Bengal state government.[59] Recent estimates of the economy of Kolkata's metropolitan area have ranged from $150 to $250 billion (PPP GDP), and have ranked it third-most productive metro area of India.[96] The 42 at Chowringhee at 260 m[97] is the tallest building in Kolkata Flexible production has been the norm in Kolkata, which has an informal sector that employs more than 40% of the labour force.[22] One unorganised group, roadside hawkers, generated business worth ₹ 87.72 billion (US$ 2 billion) in 2005.[98] As of 2001[update], around 0.81% of the city's workforce was employed in the primary sector (agriculture, forestry, mining, etc.); 15.49% worked in the secondary sector (industrial and manufacturing); and 83.69% worked in the tertiary sector (service industries).[68]: 19  As of 2003[update], the majority of households in slums were engaged in occupations belonging to the informal sector; 36.5% were involved in servicing the urban middle class (as maids, drivers, etc.) and 22.2% were casual labourers.[99]: 11  About 34% of the available labour force in Kolkata slums were unemployed.[99]: 11  According to one estimate, almost a quarter of the population live on less than 27 rupees (equivalent to 45 US cents) per day.[100] Panoramic view of the Downtown Sector V one of the major IT hubs of Kolkata as seen from the lakes surrounding Bidhannagar. Major Buildings such as Technopolis, Godrej Waterside, TCS Lords, Eden and Wanderers Park, Gobsyn Crystal, South City Pinnacle, RDB Boulevard, West Bengal Electronics Industry Development Corporation (WEBEL) Bhawan can be seen. Major manufacturing companies in the city are Alstom, Larsen & Toubro,[101] Fosroc,[102] Videocon.[103] As in many other Indian cities, information technology became a high-growth sector in Kolkata starting in the late 1990s; the city's IT sector grew at 70% per annum—a rate that was twice the national average.[59] The 2000s saw a surge of investments in the real estate, infrastructure, retail, and hospitality sectors; several large shopping malls and hotels were launched.[104][105][106][107][108] Companies such as ITC Limited, CESC Limited, Exide Industries, Emami, Eveready Industries India, Lux Industries, Rupa Company, Berger Paints, Birla Corporation, Britannia Industries and Purushottam Publishers[109] are headquartered in the city. Philips India, PricewaterhouseCoopers India, Tata Global Beverages, and Tata Steel have their registered office and zonal headquarters in Kolkata. Kolkata hosts the headquarters of three major public-sector banks: Allahabad Bank, UCO Bank, and the United Bank of India; and a private bank Bandhan Bank. Reserve Bank of India has its eastern zonal office in Kolkata, and India Government Mint, Kolkata is one of the four mints in India. Some of the oldest public sector companies are headquartered in the city such as the Coal India Limited, National Insurance Company, Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers, Tea Board of India, Geological Survey of India, Zoological Survey of India, Botanical Survey of India, Jute Corporation of India, National Test House, Hindustan Copper and the Ordnance Factories Board of the Indian Ministry of Defence.

The Kolkata Municipal Corporation, or KMC, oversees and manages the civic infrastructure of the city's 16 boroughs, which together encompass 144 wards.[118] Each ward elects a councillor to the KMC. Each borough has a committee of councillors, each of whom is elected to represent a ward. By means of the borough committees, the corporation undertakes urban planning and maintains roads, government-aided schools, hospitals, and municipal markets.[136] As Kolkata's apex body, the corporation discharges its functions through the mayor-in-council, which comprises a mayor, a deputy mayor, and ten other elected members of the KMC.[137] The functions of the KMC include water supply, drainage and sewerage, sanitation, solid waste management, street lighting, and building regulation.[136] Kolkata's administrative agencies have areas of jurisdiction that do not coincide. Listed in ascending order by area, they are: Kolkata district; the Kolkata Police area and the Kolkata Municipal Corporation area, or "Kolkata city";[138] and the Kolkata metropolitan area, which is the city's urban agglomeration. The agency overseeing the latter, the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority, is responsible for the statutory planning and development of greater Kolkata.[139] The Kolkata Municipal Corporation was ranked first out of 21 cities for best governance and administrative practices in India in 2014. It scored 4.0 on 10 compared to the national average of 3.3.[140] The Kolkata Port Trust, an agency of the central government, manages the city's river port. As of 2012[update], the All India Trinamool Congress controls the KMC; the mayor is Firhad Hakim, while the deputy mayor is Atin Ghosh.[141] The city has an apolitical titular post, that of the Sheriff of Kolkata, which presides over various city-related functions and conferences.[142] As the seat of the Government of West Bengal, Kolkata is home to not only the offices of the local governing agencies, but also the West Bengal Legislative Assembly; the state secretariat, which is housed in the Writers' Building; and the Calcutta High Court. Most government establishments and institutions are housed in the centre of the city in B. B. D. Bagh (formerly known as Dalhousie Square). The Calcutta High Court is the oldest High Court in India. It was preceded by the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William which was established in 1774. The Calcutta High Court has jurisdiction over the state of West Bengal and the Union Territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Kolkata has lower courts: the Court of Small Causes and the City Civil Court decide civil matters; the Sessions Court rules in criminal cases.[143][144][145] The Kolkata Police, headed by a police commissioner, is overseen by the West Bengal Ministry of Home Affairs.[146][147] The Kolkata district elects two representatives to India's lower house, the Lok Sabha, and 11 representatives to the state legislative assembly.[148] Utility services A telecommunications tower belonging to services provider Tata Communications The Kolkata Municipal Corporation supplies the city with potable water that is sourced from the Hooghly River;[149] most of it is treated and purified at the Palta pumping station located in North 24 Parganas district.[150][failed verification] Roughly 95% of the 4,000 tonnes of refuse produced daily by the city is transported to the dumping grounds in Dhapa, which is east of the town.[151][152] To promote the recycling of garbage and sewer water, agriculture is encouraged on the dumping grounds.[153] Parts of the city lack proper sewerage, leading to unsanitary methods of waste disposal.[80] In 1856 the Bengal Government appointed George Turnbull to be the Commissioner of Drainage and Sewerage to improve the city's sewerage. Turnbull's main job was to be the Chief Engineer of the East Indian Railway Company responsible for building the first railway 541 miles from Howrah to Varanasi (then Benares). Electricity is supplied by the privately operated Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation, or CESC, to the city proper; the West Bengal State Electricity Board supplies it in the suburbs.[154][155] Fire services are handled by the West Bengal Fire Service, a state agency.[156] As of 2012[update], the city had 16 fire stations.[157] State-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, or BSNL, as well as private enterprises, among them Vodafone, Bharti Airtel, Reliance, Idea Cellular, Aircel, Tata DoCoMo, Tata Teleservices, Virgin Mobile, and MTS India, are the leading telephone and cell phone service providers in the city.[158]: 25–26 : 179  with Kolkata being the first city in India to have cell phone and 4G connectivity, the GSM and CDMA cellular coverage is extensive.[159][160] As of 2010[update], Kolkata has 7 percent of the total Broadband internet consumers in India; BSNL, VSNL, Tata Indicom, Sify, Airtel, and Reliance are among the main vendors.[161][162] Military and diplomatic establishments The Eastern Command of the Indian Army is based in the city. Being one of India's major city and the largest city in eastern and north-eastern India, Kolkata hosts diplomatic missions of many countries such as Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Canada, People's Republic of China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Myanmar, Nepal, Russia, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, Thailand, United Kingdom and United States. The U.S Consulate in Kolkata is the US Department of State's second-oldest Consulate and dates from 19 November 1792.[163] The Diplomatic representation of more than 65 Countries and International Organization is present in Kolkata as Consulate office, honorary Consulate office, Cultural Centre, Deputy High Commission and Economic section and Trade Representation office.[164] Transport Main article: Transport in Kolkata The Kolkata Tram is the oldest operating electric tram system in Asia Public transport is provided by the Kolkata Suburban Railway, the Kolkata Metro, trams, rickshaws, taxis and buses. The suburban rail network connects the city's distant suburbs. The Kolkata Metro is the oldest rapid transit system in India According to a 2013 survey conducted by the International Association of Public Transport, in terms of a public transport system, Kolkata ranks among the top of the six Indian cities surveyed.[165][166] The Kolkata Metro, in operation since 1984, is the oldest underground mass transit system in India.[167] It spans the north–south length of the city. In 2020, part of the Second line was inaugurated to cover part of Salt Lake. This east–west line will connect Salt Lake with Howrah The 2 lines cover a distance of 33.02 km (21 mi). As of 2020[update], four Metro rail lines were under construction.[168] The Kolkata Suburban Railway is the busiest commuter rail system in India Kolkata has five long-distance railway stations, located at Howrah (the largest railway complex in India), Sealdah, Chitpur, Shalimar and Santragachi, which connect Kolkata by rail to most cities in West Bengal and to other major cities in India.[169] The city serves as the headquarters of three railway Zone out of Eighteen of the Indian Railways regional divisions—the Kolkata Metro Railways, Eastern Railway and the South-Eastern Railway.[170] Kolkata has rail and road connectivity with Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh.[171][172][173] The yellow taxi remains a favourite despite the foray of rideshare companies in the transport market Buses, which are the most commonly used mode of transport, are run by government agencies and private operators.[174] Kolkata is the only Indian city with a tram network, which is operated by the Calcutta Tramways Company.[175] The slow-moving tram services are restricted to certain areas of the city. Water-logging, caused by heavy rains during the summer monsoon, sometimes interrupt transportation networks.[176][177] Hired public conveyances include auto rickshaws, which often ply specific routes, and yellow metered taxis. Almost all of Kolkata's taxis are antiquated Hindustan Ambassadors by make; newer air-conditioned radio taxis are in service as well.[178][179] In parts of the city, cycle rickshaws and hand-pulled rickshaws are patronised by the public for short trips.[180] A road in Kolkata showing bus, and cars. There are other modes of transport available such as taxi or cab, tram, metro, auto rikshaw, rikshaw and ferry or water taxi. Due to its diverse and abundant public transportation, privately owned vehicles are not as common in Kolkata as in other major Indian cities.[181] The city has witnessed a steady increase in the number of registered vehicles; 2002 data showed an increase of 44% over a period of seven years.[182] As of 2004[update], after adjusting for population density, the city's "road space" was only 6% compared to 23% in Delhi and 17% in Mumbai.[183] The Kolkata Metro has somewhat eased traffic congestion, as has the addition of new roads and flyovers.
