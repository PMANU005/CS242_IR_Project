Elvis Presley, a rock musician of the 20th century. A musician is a person who composes, conducts, or performs music.[1] According to the United States Employment Service, "musician" is a general term used to designate one who follows music as a profession.[2] Musicians include songwriters who compose music as well as write lyrics for songs, conductors who direct a musical performance, or performers who perform for an audience. A music performer is generally either a singer who provides vocals or an instrumentalist who plays a musical instrument. Musicians may perform on their own or as part of a group, band or orchestra. Musicians specialize in a musical style, and some musicians play in a variety of different styles depending on cultures and background. A musician who records and releases music can be known as a recording artist.[3] Contents 1 Types 1.1 Composer 1.2 Conductor 1.3 Performer 2 See also 3 References 4 External links Types[edit] 1820 portrait of Ludwig van Beethoven by Joseph Karl Stieler, a major composer of the late Classical and early Romantic eras Composer[edit] Main articles: Composer and Songwriter A composer is a musician who creates musical compositions.
