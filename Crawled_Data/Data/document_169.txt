He is the middle of three children with an older and a younger sister. He is of Irish descent from his father, a stockbroker, and of Italian descent from his mother, an elementary school teacher.[2][3] Cahill graduated from Byram Hills High School in Armonk, New York in 1996.[4] He attended Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York[5] and the Atlantic Theater Acting School,[6] part of the New York University Tisch School of the Arts.[7] Career[edit] In 2000 Cahill performed in Nicky Silver's Off-Broadway production of The Altruists.[8] He was noticed by Sarah Jessica Parker[9] and shortly after he made several television guest-star appearances including Sex and the City, Felicity, and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Cahill was also a recurring guest-star in the NBC sitcom Friends as Rachel's young assistant and boyfriend, Tag Jones. In 2002, he starred in a short-lived WB drama, Glory Days.[10] In the 2004 hockey movie Miracle, Cahill had the chance to play his boyhood hero, goalie Jim Craig.[11] He had never played the goaltender position prior to the movie,[12] so most of the game-action sequences of Craig were filmed with former NHL goalie Bill Ranford doubling for Cahill, although Cahill did shoot several key sequences from within goal.[13] Cahill in 2005 When CBS decided in 2004 to create a third CSI series, CSI: NY, to add to its franchise, Cahill was hired to play the cocky, snarky homicide detective, Don Flack, who backs up the team of CSIs and who gets some of the best lines.[14][15] The show ran for nine seasons and he was in all 197 episodes. Cahill went back to the Atlantic Theater Company in June 2011 and performed at the conclusion of their 25th Anniversary season.[16] He was in Tom Donaghy's one-act play, I Need a Quote, about "a hilarious telephone conversation between a single mother and a home insurance salesman."[17] In the summer of 2012 Cahill performed in David Adjmi's play, 3C, at the Rattlestick Playwrights Theater in New York City.[18] He played "annoying neighbor Terry, a swinging bachelor true to the era, who unlike everyone else in this play, has no deep feelings at all."[19] In 2014 Cahill was cast as a main character starting in the second season of the CBS summer drama Under the Dome. He played Sam Verdreaux, a former EMT and reclusive brother-in-law to "Big Jim" Rennie.[20] The series was canceled after three seasons.[21] Cahill was cast as the male lead in the 2016 ABC legal drama Conviction. He played New York County District Attorney Conner Wallace, who creates the Conviction Integrity Unit, which is set up to re-examine cases where there is a credible suspicion of wrongful conviction.[22] The series was canceled after one season.[23] In 2019 Cahill played a charismatic criminal in a three-part story arc in CBS's NCIS: New Orleans. Among other crimes he was involved in the death of NCIS Special Agent Christopher Lasalle.[24] In this series, he reunited with his former CSI: NY co-star, Vanessa Ferlito. Personal life[edit] Cahill married his longtime girlfriend Nikki Uberti in Los Angeles on July 12, 2009.[25] Uberti is a makeup artist,[26] former model,[27] and ex-wife of photographer Terry Richardson.[28] The couple have a son born in 2009.[29] On his right shoulder Cahill has a tattoo of his wife's name in a heart with an arrow through it and a swallow on top.[30] Cahill is an avid New York Rangers hockey fan and wrote an NHL Celeb Blog for three seasons.[31][32] Filmography[edit] Year Title Role Notes Stage 1999 Gramercy Park is Closed to the Public Dex Powerhouse Theater[33][34] 2000 The Altruists Lance Vineyard Theatre[35] 2011 I Need a Quote Salesman Atlantic Theater Company[36] 2012 3C Terry Rattlestick Playwrights Theater[37][38] 2019 Nassim n/a New York City Center[39][40] 2019 The Hard Problem Jerry Krohl James Bridges Theater[41][42] Television 2000 Sex and the City Sean Episode 3.04 "Boy, Girl, Boy, Girl..." 2000–2001 Friends Tag Jones Episodes 7.04 "The One with Rachel's Assistant" 7.05 "The One with the Engagement Picture" 7.08 "The One Where Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs" 7.09 "The One with All the Candy" 7.12 "The One Where They're Up All Night" 7.14 "The One Where They All Turn Thirty" 8.02 "The One with the Red Sweater" 2000 Charmed Sean Episode 3.05 "Sight Unseen" 2000 Felicity James Episodes 3.09 "James and the Giant Piece" 3.10 "Let's Get It On" aka "Final Touches" 3.11 "And to All a Good Night" 2001 Law & Order: Special Victims Unit Tommy Dowd Episode 2.17 "Folly" 2002 Glory Days Mike Dolan All 9 episodes 2002 Haunted Nicholas Trenton Episodes 1.07 "A Three-Hour Tour" 1.09 "Simon Redux" 2002 Dawson's Creek Max Winter Episode 6.09 "Everything Put Together Falls Apart" 2004–2013 CSI: NY Don Flack All 197 episodes 2014–2015 Under the Dome Sam Verdreaux 26 episodes (2.01–3.13) 2016–2017 Conviction Conner Wallace All 13 episodes 2018 Hawaii Five-0 Carson Rodes Episode 9.06 "Aia i Hi'ikua; i Hi'ialo" ("Is Borne on the Back; Is Borne in the Arms") 2019 L.A.'s Finest Michael Alber Episodes 1.12 "Armageddon" 1.13 "Bad Girls" 2019 NCIS: New Orleans Eddie Barrett Episodes 6.06 "Matthew 5:9" 6.09 "Convicted" 6.10 "Requital" 2021 Fantasy Island Jake / James Episodes 1.09 "Welcome to the Snow Globe, Part One" 1.10 "Welcome to the Snow Globe, Part Two" Film 2004 Miracle Jim Craig Bill Ranford doubled for most of the on-ice action.[13] 2005 Lords of Dogtown Larry Gordon 2008 This Is Not a Test Robert Forte Cahill worked with CSI: NY castmates Hill Harper and Carmine Giovinazzo. 2008 The Narrows Nicky Shades Cahill was burned when a special effect went wrong.[43] 2019 Sextpert Advice Sydney Short film[44][45] Other 2004 The Making of "Miracle" Himself Video short documentary[46][47] 2004 From Hockey to Hollywood: Actors' Journeys Himself Video short documentary[48][49] 2008 CSI: NY – The Game Don Flack Video game (voice only)[50] References[edit] ^ Trongo, Rachel (January 15, 2013).
