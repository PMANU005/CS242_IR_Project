Most programming air in their original English audio, with subtitles in Spanish (for Latin American countries except Brazil), Portuguese (for Brazil), Chinese (for Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore), Malaysian (for Malaysia) and Indonesian (for Indonesia), however, there are also some dubbed programming. On November 1, 2015, the Latin American channel changed it to dub a programming instead of just subtitling them. This caused an uproar to most of its audience. Warner TV's headquarters are located in Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Singapore, and Malaysia; the broadcasting, however, is based in Miami for Latin American viewers and Singapore for Asian viewers. On November 9, 2017, Turner Broadcasting System France and Canal+ both launched Warner TV in France, replacing Syfy which became a SFR exclusive.[1] All television series airing on the channel are sourced from the library of Warner Bros., which licensed its name to the channel until 2019. In March 2015, the Filipino feed separated from the Southeast Asian Warner TV channel to air a different programming schedule, including selected programming from truTV.[2] On April 22, 2020, the French version launched in Sub-Saharan Africa in StarTimes. On May 2, 2020, Warner TV began broadcasting the Adult Swim programming block in Latin America and Brazil, which initially included Rick and Morty, Final Space, Robot Chicken, and Aqua Teen Hunger Force.[3][4][5] On May 3, 2021, Metalocalypse and The Shivering Truth were added to the Adult Swim programming block.[6] On September 24, 2021, Final Space was pulled from Warner TV's lineup. On November 8, 2021, Adult Swim was pulled from Warner TV's lineup. On June 14, 2021, it was announced that the TNT channels in Germany would be rebranded into Warner TV from September 25, 2021.[7] On July 8, 2021, it was announced that TNT in Poland and Romania would rebrand into Warner TV from October 23, 2021.[8][9] Contents 1 Programming 1.1 2016 1.2 2015 1.3 2014 1.4 2013 1.5 2012 1.6 2011 1.7 2010 1.8 2009 1.9 2008 1.10 2007 1.11 2006 1.12 2005 1.13 Others 2 References 3 External links Programming[edit] Shows marked with a parenthesis after the title are Southeast-Asia-only programs unless otherwise noted.
