The special is hosted by James Corden and executive produced by the show's co-creators, Marta Kauffman and David Crane, Kevin S. Bright, the show's main cast, and Ben Winston (who also directed the special). The special sees the main cast revisit the sets of the original show (such as the Friends' apartments, the Central Perk coffee shop, and the signature water fountain), meet with guests who appeared on the show as well as celebrity guests, do table reads and re-enactments of Friends episodes, and share behind-the-scenes footage.[2] Contents 1 Production 1.1 Development 1.2 Filming 2 Cast 2.1 Main cast 2.2 Original show producers 2.3 Host 2.4 Guest stars 3 Release 4 Reception 4.1 Critical response 4.2 Ratings 4.3 Accolades 5 See also 6 References 7 External links Production[edit] Development[edit] In November 2019, Warner Bros. Television was developing a Friends reunion special for their new streaming service, HBO Max. The special would feature the whole cast and co-stars.[3] In February 2020, an unscripted Friends was commissioned with all original cast and co-creators returning.[4][5][6] The special was executive produced by the show's co-creators, Kevin S. Bright, Marta Kauffman and David Crane, and the show's main cast, Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer. Ben Winston directed and executive produced through Fulwell 73. Warner Bros. Unscripted & Alternative Television (later Warner Horizon Unscripted Television) was also involved in the production of the special.[4] Filming[edit] The special was filmed in Los Angeles, California, at Stage 24, also known as "The Friends Stage" at Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank, where Friends had been filmed since its second season.[5][7] The filming of the reunion began in April 2021. Filming of the special was delayed twice, first in March 2020,[8] and second in August 2020, both due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[7][9] The trivia game and talk show segments of the special, hosted by James Corden, were filmed in front of a live audience of "mostly union extras, [who were] COVID screened and hired for the gig".[7] Representatives for Perry clarified that he had an emergency dental surgery prior to filming when viewers were concerned about his appearance. In an episode of Rob Lowe's podcast released in January 2021, Kudrow said she had only seen the rebuilt Central Perk set and filmed "a little something" which eventually became Lady Gaga's appearance recorded in November 2020. Director and producer Ben Winston stated the cast trivia game segment was being planned out in March 2021 while producing The Late Late Show and the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards.
