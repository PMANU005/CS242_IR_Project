The schedule covers primetime hours from September 2003 through August 2004. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancelled after the 2002–03 season. All times are Eastern and Pacific, with certain exceptions, such as Monday Night Football. New series are highlighted in bold. Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.[1] The 2003–2004 season marked the final time that the major networks scheduled substantial original scripted drama series on Saturdays. After years of declining ratings on that particular evening, beginning with the 2004–2005 season the networks ceased scheduling original dramas on Saturdays, choosing instead to fill the schedule with non-fiction programming and reruns. Yellow indicates the programs in the top 10 for the season. Cyan indicates the programs in the top 20 for the season. Magenta indicates the programs in the top 30 for the season. PBS is not included; member stations have local flexibility over most of their schedules and broadcast times for network shows may vary. From August 13 to 29, 2004, all of NBC's primetime programming was preempted in favor of coverage of the 2004 Summer Olympics.
