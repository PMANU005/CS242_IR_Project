Pick-up line - WikipediaPick-up line From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search The Flirtation by Eugene de Blaas. A pick-up line or chat-up line is a conversation opener with the intent of engaging a person for romance or dating. As overt and sometimes humorous displays of romantic interest, pick-up lines advertise the wit of their speakers to their target listeners. Pick-up lines range from straightforward conversation openers such as introducing oneself, providing information about oneself, or asking someone about their likes[1] and common interests,[2] to more elaborate attempts including flattery[3] or humour. Novices are advised to avoid standardised and hackneyed lines (particularly those resembling country songs[4]) and to put their opening in an interrogative form, if possible.[5] See also[edit] Wikiquote has quotations related to: Pick-up lines Flirting Limerence Seduction community Romance (love) Wit References[edit] ^ Kuriansky, Judith (2003).
