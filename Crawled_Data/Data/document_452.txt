Bright (Executive Producer) Kevin S. Bright began his career in New York City with the Joseph Cates Company, where he produced variety specials starring David Copperfield, George Burns, Dolly Parton and Johnny Cash. He later moved to Los Angeles, where he produced for HBO the CableACE Award-winning series "The History of White People in America." At HBO, he also produced comedy specials for Robin Williams, Martin Mull, Paul Shaffer and Harry Shearer. In 1989, Bright received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series while serving as supervising producer on the hit show "In Living Color." In that same year, Bright began his relationship with Marta Kauffman and David Crane as executive producer on the popular HBO series "Dream On," which won a 1992 CableACE Award for Best Comedy Series. In 1990, he also served as executive producer of the critically acclaimed "Ron Reagan Show." In 1993, Bright entered into a partnership with Kauffman and Crane to form Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions and began a development deal with Warner Bros. Television, where the company has gone on to produce the comedy series "Friends," "Veronica's Closet" and, most recently, "Jesse." Continuing as a top-rated series, "Friends" received two People's Choice Awards for Favorite Television Comedy Series (1999-2000 and 2000-2001) and also won the award in its first season (1994-95) for Best New Comedy Series. In eight successful seasons, "Friends" has received 44 Emmy Award nominations and six Golden Globe Award nominations.

Previously, they created and served as co-executive producers on the critically acclaimed, award-winning comedy series "Dream On." While on "Dream On," they received an Emmy Award nomination and a CableACE Award for writing the episode "For Peter's Sake."

In addition, they served as executive producers on the series "Jesse," starring Christina Applegate. Both Philadelphia natives, Crane and Kauffman began their writing careers at Brandeis University. They began their working relationship in the theatre in New York, where they teamed with composer Michael Skloff to write several musicals, including the stage version of the movie "Arthur." They also co-wrote the book and lyrics for the widely acclaimed musical "Personals," for which they received an Outer Critics Circle Award and a Drama Desk Award nomination. A new production of "Personals" recently played in London's West End. Crane and Kauffman contributed musical and sketch material to the off-Broadway revues "A...My Name is Alice" and "Martin Charnin's Upstairs at O'Neals." Kauffman lives in Los Angeles with her husband, Michael Skloff; her three children, Hannah, Sam and Rose; four horses; two dogs; and two cats.
