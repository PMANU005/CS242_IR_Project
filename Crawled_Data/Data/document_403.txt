Why, for example, does the 2003 season finale of the Fox reality show "Joe Millionaire" rank third on The Hollywood Reporter's list of the most-watched TV episodes of the decade? The top show is no head-scratcher. It's the May 6, 2004 series finale of "Friends," which averaged 52.5 million viewers. Others on the Reporter's list, however, might come as a surprise. (Two things to note: The list is limited to TV shows, so it excludes events such as the Super Bowl and the Oscars. And it excludes duplicate titles, so a regular ratings giant like "American Idol" is only represented once, by its top audience figure.)
