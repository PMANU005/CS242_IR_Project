Contents 1 History 2 Programming 2.1 Former programmes 3 See also 4 References 5 External links History[edit] On 24 October 2008, the channel was launched with a promo loop on Foxtel as 111 Hits, running in 16:9 widescreen in a run-up to its official 1 November 2008 launch as a companion to The Comedy Channel. Its first programme was a special edition of Countdown with guests Jenna Elfman and Jermaine Jackson.[1][2] On 1 March 2009, the channel became available to Austar subscribers.[3] The timeshift channel 111+2 launched 15 November 2009. After a revised logo and branding campaign rolled out over the holidays of 2013, the channel's name was officially shortened on 1 January 2014 to 111 with the launch of TV Hits.[4] After only four months, on 20 April 2014, it was rebranded to 111 Greats, before reverting simply to 111 on 1 August 2015. The channel launched on Fetch TV at the end of February 2017. On 7 November 2019, 111 funny was rebranded as Fox Funny as part of Foxtel's rebranding and takeover of several networks.[5] An HD feed of the network was launched with the rebranding. Programming[edit] Final logo as "111". Programming primarily consists of American sitcoms from Warner Bros., 20th Century Fox, Sony Pictures Television, and CBS Studios International. As 111 launched, programming was slowly revealed through promotions on other Foxtel channels, with presenters discussing a show and their memories of it. At launch, a majority of its shows were moved from Arena, FOX8, The Comedy Channel, TV1 and Fox Classics. On 1 January 2014, with the addition of TV Hits following the closure of TV1, there was a change in direction to the networks catalogue of programs, with a large amount of newer material (mainly sitcoms and dramas) moved from 111 Hits to TV Hits. As a result, 111 Hits was shortened to 111. New additions to programming (which were previously shown on TV1) included classics such as Cheers, Frasier, and Get Smart, as well as newer shows such as Rules of Engagement.[4][6] On 1 November 2015, the network changed its focus solely to sitcoms. This saw the sitcoms which were moved to TV Hits the year prior returned and the removal of drama programming (with a large majority moved to other Foxtel-owned channels).[7][non-primary source needed] With the rebrand to Fox Funny, the channel removed sitcoms from the 80s and 90s (which moved to sister channel Fox Comedy) and became home to more recent sitcoms from the 2000s and 2010s. 30 Rock The Big Bang Theory How I Met Your Mother Mike & Molly Modern Family Mom My Name is Earl New Girl The Office Rules of Engagement Scrubs Two and a Half Men (seasons 9-12 only, seasons 1-8 on Fox Comedy) Former programmes[edit] 21 Jump Street 3rd Rock from the Sun ALF All Saints Ally McBeal America's Funniest Home Videos Batman Baywatch The Beverly Hillbillies Bewitched Bones Cheers Chicago Hope CHiPs Cold Case Cougar Town The Cosby Show Dawson's Creek Desperate Housewives Dharma & Greg Diff'rent Strokes Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman The Drew Carey Show Ellen ER Everybody Loves Raymond The Flintstones Frasier The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Friends Fringe Full House Get Smart Ghost Whisperer Gilligan's Island Gilmore Girls Green Acres Grey's Anatomy Happy Endings Home Improvement Homicide: Life on the Street Hot in Cleveland I Dream of Jeannie Judging Amy Just Shoot Me!
