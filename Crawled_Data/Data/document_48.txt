It appeared in the May 4–10, 2002 issue of the magazine, which was the second in a series of special issues commemorating TV Guide's 50th year (the others were "TV We'll Always Remember", "50 Greatest Covers", "50 Worst TV Shows of All Time", "50 Greatest Cartoon Characters" and "50 Sexiest Stars"). The list was also counted down in an ABC television special, TV Guide's 50 Best Shows of All Time, on May 13, 2002.

TV movies, miniseries and specials were not eligible.[1] The special aired at 10:00 pm and was viewed by 8.9 million people, giving it a 6 rating and a 10 share.[2] Considering the cover story for this special issue of TV Guide, it was the only one of the six to be presented on television.
