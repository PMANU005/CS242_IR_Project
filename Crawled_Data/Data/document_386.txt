JB Hi-Fi was established in the Melbourne suburb of Keilor East by John Barbuto in 1974.[1] Barbuto sold the business in 1983 to Richard Bouris, David Rodd, and Peter Caserta, who expanded JB Hi-Fi into a chain of ten stores in Melbourne and Sydney turning over $150 million by 2000, when they sold the majority of their holding to private equity. It was subsequently floated on the ASX in October 2003.[2] As of August 2018, JB Hi-Fi is ranked as the equal 7th largest consumer electronics and home appliance retailer in the world.[3] On 28 April 2021, it was announced that Richard Murray, JB Hi-Fi's CEO of seven years, would be leaving his role at the end of August to work alongside trader Solomon Lew at the latter's company Premier Investments. Terry Smart, the head of electronics retailer the Good Guys, was announced as Murray's replacement on the same day.[4] Acquisitions[edit] In July 2004, JB Hi-Fi bought 70% of the Clive Anthonys chain in Queensland.[2] On 13 December 2006, JB Hi-Fi acquired the Hill and Stewart chain of 11 electronics stores selling and operating in New Zealand for NZ$17.5 million (A$15.3 million).[5] JB Hi-Fi later established stores under their own JB Hi-Fi brand, and closed all Hill and Stewart stores in 2010.[6] On 13 September 2016, JB Hi-Fi announced its acquisition of the Good Guys, for $870 million, the acquisition resulted in JB Hi-Fi group enlarging its share of the Australian home appliances retail market to 29% and growing its share of the consumer electronics retail market to 24%.[7] Controversies[edit] On 22 September 2015, a man with Down Syndrome was refused entry into a JB Hi-Fi store in Brisbane, Australia, after being confused for another person who had been banned from the store. The resulting media attention resulted in CEO Richard Murray publicly apologizing to the family.[8] References[edit] ^ "About us". JB Hi-Fi.
