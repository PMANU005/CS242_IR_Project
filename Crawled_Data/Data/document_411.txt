Usually I don't put down opinions of others, but this list is missing A LOT of shows. Gams Posted: 11 months ago at Aug 13 8:46 I agree with Lershy, for me in this list is missing Nip-Tuck and some more skontch1 Posted: 11 months ago at Aug 13 11:42 i would never say the list is awful, since it's your opinion. i will say, however, that i strongly disagree. no twilight zone, the honeymooners, all in the family, the odd couple, i love lucy, to name a few. maybe i'm just old... silent killer Posted: 11 months ago at Aug 13 14:43 It's not just you. the shows on this list are good, but hardly the greatest. jay-jay Posted: 11 months ago at Aug 15 11:27 This was Empire Magazine's List not his/hers. I voted because Buffy/Angel/Heroes/Lost made the list.
