That way, as the pages that are referenced are changed or taken from the web, a link to the version that was live when the page was written will be preserved. Then the Internet Archive hopes that references to these archived pages will be put in place of a link that would be otherwise be broken, or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page's authors. The goal is to fix all broken links on the web. Crawls of supported "No More 404" sites. Collection: Wikipedia Near Real Time (from IRC) This is a collection of web page captures from links added to, or changed on, Wikipedia pages. The idea is to bring a reliability to Wikipedia outlinks so that if the pages referenced by Wikipedia articles are changed, or go away, a reader can permanently find what was originally referred to. This is part of the Internet Archive's attempt to rid the web of broken links.

May 23, 1997|BRIAN LOWRY | TIMES STAFF WRITER NBC has found it difficult expanding the "Must See" franchise beyond Thursday, though not for lack of trying. Despite mediocre results with sitcoms Monday and Wednesday this season, the network will schedule a record 18 comedies across five nights in the fall. NBC Entertainment President Warren Littlefield explained that the network is "trying to spread out our offense" to new nights. Despite losing viewers, NBC ruled the demographic race by the widest margin in a decade--when Bill Cosby was on its schedule--and scored the first back-to-back prime-time wins since CBS won three consecutive years, ending in 1993-94. As for Cosby, his new CBS program was far from a runaway hit but did become the highest-rated comedy to open a night at 8 p.m. since his last show a dozen years ago. Fox not only improved compared to last season but launched one of the few new-series hits in "King of the Hill," which successfully bridged the gap between "The Simpsons" and "The X-Files" Sunday nights. Moving "X-Files" also bore ratings dividends that more than offset the decline experienced Fridays by replacing it with a new show, "Millennium." Fox's overall results were aided in part by televising two of the year's top sporting events, the Super Bowl and the World Series. In a case of the rich possibly getting richer, NBC will broadcast both next season. (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Top 20 Series of '96-'97 Season *--* Avg Viewers Network in Millions 1.
