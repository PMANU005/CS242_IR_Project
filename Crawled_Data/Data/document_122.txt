They picked "The One with Rachel's Other Sister" as its best episode.[1] Cast and characters[edit] See also: List of Friends characters (In particular, Introduced in season 9 or Only in season 9) Main cast[edit] Jennifer Aniston as Rachel Green Courteney Cox-Arquette as Monica Geller Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe Buffay Matt LeBlanc as Joey Tribbiani Matthew Perry as Chandler Bing David Schwimmer as Ross Geller Recurring cast[edit] Paul Rudd as Mike Hannigan Hank Azaria as David Aisha Tyler as Charlie Wheeler Dermot Mulroney as Gavin Mitchell Phill Lewis as Steve Melissa George as Molly James Michael Tyler as Gunther Guest stars[edit] Maggie Wheeler as Janice Litman-Goralnik Elliott Gould as Jack Geller Christina Pickles as Judy Geller Christina Applegate as Amy Green Freddie Prinze Jr. as Sandy Selma Blair as Wendy John Stamos as Zack Jeff Goldblum as Leonard Hayes Cleo King as Nurse Kitty Janet Hubert as Ms. McKenna Kyle Gass as Lowell the Mugger Episodes[edit] See also: List of Friends episodes No. overall No. in season Title Directed by Written by Original air date Prod. code U.S. viewers (millions) 195 1 "The One Where No One Proposes" Kevin S.
