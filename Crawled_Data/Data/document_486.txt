Friends Now Playing: Friends Series Details & Credits NBC | Release Date: September 22, 1994 Starring: Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, David Schwimmer, Courteney Cox Summary: In 1994, the idea was created for "Friends": a show about six friends in New York as they navigate their way through life and learn to grow up as they approach the third decade of their life. All, with the help from each other to get them through the obstacles that life naturally has for us. Monica is the excessively neat and organizedIn 1994, the idea was created for "Friends": a show about six friends in New York as they navigate their way through life and learn to grow up as they approach the third decade of their life. All, with the help from each other to get them through the obstacles that life naturally has for us. Monica is the excessively neat and organized "older sister" of the group, who works as a chef while yearning to find her ideal love. Ross, Monica's older brother, is a paleontologist with a lifelong crush on Rachel. He is a laid-back man with low self esteem and a recent divorcee. Rachel is the pretty, bubbly girl who spent most of her life as a spoiled rich princess. Now she must learn to face the real world. Chandler is Ross' college buddy and the guy who will crack jokes at a moment's notice. Phoebe is a lovable eccentric masseuse who easily could have fit in with Haight Ashbury in the 1960s. And Joey, the friend who has an inverse relationship between his good looks and his intelligence. He dreams of becoming an actor. These six individuals make up the cast of Friends. In May 2004, Friends officially ended it's phenomenal 10 year run. The show's time slot was taken over by a spin-off called Joey.… Expand Genre(s): Comedy Watch Now Stream On Buy on Stream On Stream On Stream On Stream On Expand Recent Episodes tbd S10:E20.

Read full review 91 Ken Tucker Jun 11, 2013 Season 1 Review: At its best, Friends operates like a first-rate Broadway farce, complete with slamming doors, twisty plots, and intricately strung together jokes. And even when it's not at its best, the crack acting and piquant punchlines give Friends a momentum and charm that win you over even if you're not laughing. Read full review 88 Mike Antonucci Feb 27, 2013 Season 1 Review: All the weird, impulsive jokes are as outrageously funny as they aspire to be. [22 Sept 1994, p.1C] 70 Ed Bark Feb 27, 2013 Season 1 Review: None of the six main actors is a stand-up comic, but they're appealing nonetheless...If the scripts get a little sharper, Friends may attract enough of the right demographics to become a hit. [22 Sept 1994] 50 Marvin Kitman Jul 12, 2013 Season 1 Review: The trouble with "Friends" is that Cox is not strong enough as a comedian. [5 Sep 1994] 50 Hal Boedeker Feb 27, 2013 Season 1 Review: Wildly uneven. [22 Sept 1994] 0 Tom Shales Feb 27, 2013 Season 1 Review: Friends comes across like a 30-minute commercial for Dockers or Ikea or light beer, except it's smuttier. One character says he dreamed he had a telephone for a penis and when it rang, "it turns out it's my mother." And this is in the first five minutes...Another ghastly creation from professional panderers Marta Kauffman and David Crane, the witless duo who do "Dream On" for HBO, Friends is more a scripted talk show than a sitcom. You keep waiting for Sally Jessy or some other cluck to interrupt the jabbering. The show is so bad that Sally Jessy would actually come as a relief.
