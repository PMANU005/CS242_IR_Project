On-again, off-again relationship - WikipediaOn-again, off-again relationship From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from On-and-off relationship) Jump to navigation Jump to search Type of interpersonal relationship An on-again, off-again relationship (also known as an on–off or off–on relationship) is a form of personal relationship between two persons who keep breaking up only to reconcile afterwards, thus repeating a cycle.[1][2] Researcher Kale Monk, an assistant professor of human development and family sciences at the University of Missouri, cites several reasons as to why a relationship might be on-again, off-again, including one partner relocating to a new place or the couple re-assessing their relationship.[3] Many continue to reunite out of a persistent hope that the moments of happiness and gratification they have known will eventually constitute the entire relationship.[4] Being in an on-again, off-again relationship can damage one's mental health,[5][3] leading to possible depression, eating disorder, and/or anxiety.[6][7] Additionally, Monk also notes how these types of relationships have higher rates of abuse, poorer communication, and lower levels of commitment.[5] Not all on-again, off-again relationships are considered toxic, as breaking up and reconciling can help a couple with better communication and address the issues in their relationships.[1][5] A 2009 study published in the Personal Relationships journal revealed that nearly two-thirds of participants have experienced being in an on-again, off-again relationship.[8][2] References[edit] ^ a b McAlex, Alice; er (30 October 2015).
